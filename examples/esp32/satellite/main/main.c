/*
 * Satellite responder on ESP32 + DWM3000EVB.
 *
 * The ESP-IDF twin of apps/satellite/src/main.c, and deliberately the same
 * shape: the whole ranging engine is the module's, and this file only supplies
 * what BLE negotiation supplies on the lock — the session keys and PHY. They
 * arrive either over the sealed link or pasted at the console:
 *
 *   sat_join <ursk-hex64> <rcfg-hex34> <channel> <sync-code>
 *
 * What goes back is one sealed WV3 report per accepted range: this board's own
 * distance to the phone, and the ranging BLOCK it was measured in. The block
 * travels with it because the lock cannot pair a distance whose round it does
 * not know — mispairing shows up as triangle rejections that read as a
 * hardware fault.
