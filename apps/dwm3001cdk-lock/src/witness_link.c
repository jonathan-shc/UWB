/**
 * @file witness_link.c — sealed WV2 witness reports over Thread UDP.
 *
 * Three jobs, in order of how much they matter:
 *
 * 1. Refuse anything that is not a fresh report from an enrolled witness.
 *    AES-CCM under a per-witness key, a monotonic counter per witness boot,
 *    and -- for evidence that could CLEAR the inside veto -- an echo of the
 *    lock's current challenge nonce. A witness holds no authority: every rule
 *    is enforced here, and the worst a forged or flooding witness achieves is
 *    a door that does not open passively.
 *
 * 2. Work out which advertiser in the room is the credential, without ever
 *    learning who the credential is. See ultrawidelock_witness_pick.h: the
 *    address the lock holds from the BLE connection is an InitA and the
 *    addresses the witnesses hear come from advertising sets, so matching one
 *    against the other is unsound. Trajectory correlation replaces it.
 *
 * 3. Hand the paired inside/outside window to the same inbox the RTT bench
 *    feed publishes to, so the side gate and the latch consume evidence
 *    through one path whatever delivered it.
 *
 * Runs entirely on the datagram link's receive callback and the main loop;
 * starts no thread. The transport itself is ultrawidelock_dgram.h -- this file
 * names no OpenThread symbol and takes no OpenThread lock. What it sends is a
 * sealed blob to the group; who carries it is the port's business.
