 * DWM3001CDK provisioning console.
 *
 * This board cannot be commissioned into Apple Home on its own (no Matter image
 * fits an nRF52833), so it adopts a credential exported from a board that was.
 * The point of this file is WHERE that credential lives: in NVS, as per-device
 * data typed in over USB, never in the firmware image. One image is then the
 * same for everybody, and carries no key.
 *
 * Reachable only in provisioning mode -- hold SW2 through reset -- where main()
 * brings up USB CDC-ACM and deliberately never starts the radios. Everything
 * here therefore reads and writes the settings store directly (ultrawidelock_prov_*)
 * rather than the running engine's state, which in this mode does not exist.
 * The one exception is `import`, which routes through ultrawidelock_reader_import_blob
 * so the engine's own commit path stays the single place that adopts identity.
 *
 * It carries the BLE witness link keys for the same reason, though they belong
 * to a different subsystem: they are per-install secrets that must not be in an
 * image, and the image that uses them has no console. See cmd_witkey.
