# Run scripts/bootstrap.sh first.
#
# Named for its board because BOARD below is hardcoded: this script builds
# nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp and nothing else. The DWM3001CDK is built straight
# from apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/ by mk/cdk.mk, and the ESP32 apps by mk/esp32.mk.
#
# Layers our modules + ISC dw3000 onto the fetched add-on via out-of-tree
# overlays. Output → build/nrf5340dk (git-ignored), or build/nrf5340dk-blob
# when ALIRO_SOURCE=0, so flipping that flag no longer forces a pristine rebuild.
#
# Incremental by default — a full from-scratch (pristine) build runs only when it
# has to: first build, changed build flags (UWB chip / self-test / config), or
# when you ask for one. A preflight first checks the workspace is bootstrapped.
