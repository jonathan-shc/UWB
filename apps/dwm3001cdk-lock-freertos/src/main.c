/*
 * Entry point for the DWM3001CDK lock.
 *
 * Startup order here is not arbitrary and is the thing to preserve as the rest
 * of the product is added below it.
 *
 * The radio starts first, before the scheduler. MPSL owns CLOCK and starts the
 * low-frequency crystal inside mpsl_init(); RTC1 carries the FreeRTOS tick and
 * counts from that same crystal. Starting the scheduler first would mean
 * starting it on a clock that is not running yet, which board/tick_freertos.c
 * turns into a named fatal rather than a hang, but which is still a board that
 * never boots.
 *
 * Creating tasks before the scheduler runs is legal, and the notifications
 * MPSL's low-priority handler posts in the meantime are latched and delivered
 * once it starts, so nothing is lost in the window.
 *
 * A failed radio start is fatal here rather than degraded. A lock with no radio
 * cannot be opened by any of the three ways this product supports, so coming up
 * far enough to log the reason and reset is more useful than coming up far
 * enough to look healthy.
