 * Zephyr's OpenThread integration header, over this port's runtime.

 * exact equivalent here, because both builds run the same OpenThread with the
 * same single-lock discipline: the stack is not internally synchronised, and
 * every call into it happens with one mutex held.
 *
 * This is a SEPARATE shim from thread/ot_compat/openthread.h, which is empty on
 * purpose -- the pinned radio platform includes that header and names nothing
 * from it, and a check exists to fail the build if that ever changes. Extending
 * the empty one to serve this file would quietly hand the radio platform a set
 * of functions it is asserted not to use.
