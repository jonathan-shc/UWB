/*
 * Build configuration for the shared Matter Thread transport.
 *
 * ports/zephyr/matter/matter_thread_port.c is compiled into this image
 * unmodified. Despite where it lives it is not Zephyr code in substance: every
 * line of it is either an OpenThread API call or one of four openthread_*()
 * helpers, and this port already has an exact equivalent of each. Its Zephyr
 * surface is three headers, which matter_compat/ supplies.
 *
 * It is compiled in place rather than copied. A copy of 1,227 lines would drift
 * from the oracle silently, and the SRP behaviour encoded in it -- the host-name
 * suffix that avoids a 14-day key-lease collision, in particular -- was learned
 * the expensive way and should exist once. Its proper home is modules/, beside
 * the protocol it serves; moving it means editing the Zephyr module's
 * CMakeLists, and that build is not gated here, so the move waits until both
 * can be verified in one step. scripts/freertos-matter-source-check.sh fails
 * the build if the file starts using anything this shim does not provide.
 *
 * Symbols that stay undefined are the disabled half. Do not define any of them
 * to 0: the file tests them with #if defined().

 *
 * A Zephyr build injects these through its own forced includes, so a source
 * file may use BUILD_ASSERT or EINVAL without including anything that declares
 * them. matter_fab_settings.c does exactly that: its only Zephyr includes are
 * logging and settings, and it still uses BUILD_ASSERT, ARRAY_SIZE and EINVAL.
 * Putting them in kernel.h looked right and changed nothing, because that file
 * never includes kernel.h.

 * This header is -include'd on every source in the library, which is the same
