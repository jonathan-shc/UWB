/**
 * @file matter_ble_freertos.c — the 0xFFF6 GATT service that carries BTP, on NimBLE.
 *
 * A thin adapter, on purpose. All the framing lives in modules/ultrawidelock_matter
 * (matter_btp.c), which has no operating system dependency and is tested on the
 * host under sanitizers. This file does three things and no more: hand C1
 * writes to the reassembler, drive the fragmenter out through C2 indications,
 * and build the commissionable advertisement.
 *
 * This is the ONE piece of the Matter port that could not be shimmed. The Thread
 * transport is compiled from the Zephyr tree unmodified because it is OpenThread
 * calls underneath; this is Zephyr's bt_* GATT against NimBLE's, and the two
 * differ in shape, not just in spelling. What is carried across is the
 * BEHAVIOUR, and specifically the four things the Zephyr file records as having
 * been learned from live hardware. Each is marked below. They cost real
 * debugging sessions against real iPhones and none of them is inferable from the
 * specification.
 *
 * C1 (RX, write) is 18EE2EF5-263D-4559-959F-4F9C429F9D11, C2 (TX, indicate)
 * ...D12, spelled below in the little-endian order NimBLE's UUID macros want.
 *
 * NOT wired into the reader's advertising. The reader owns the single
 * advertising set, and matter_ble_commissionable_svc_data() only BUILDS the
 * payload -- an image with this file compiled in behaves exactly as before until
 * something asks for those bytes.

 * first C1 write, so the flag got set and then cleared by the reset that the C1
 * write triggers. The queued handshake response was never sent, the phone sat on
 * "connecting" until it gave up, and nothing in the log said why.
 *
 * NimBLE has no equivalent query -- subscription state arrives only as a
 * BLE_GAP_EVENT_SUBSCRIBE edge -- so a mirror is unavoidable here. The bug is
 * avoided instead by WHERE it is cleared: this variable is owned by the
 * subscribe and disconnect events alone. reset_link() deliberately does not
 * touch it, because reset_link() runs on the C1 write that claims the link, and
