/**
 * @file matter_settings_freertos.h — the settings API the shared Matter sources use.
 *
 * THE CANONICAL DECLARATIONS LIVE HERE, in the port's own spelling. The
 * Zephyr-named header beside it in matter_compat/ forwards to this one; it is a
 * translation of a foreign API's file NAME and nothing else.
 *
 * The direction matters, and it is the same one matter_ble_freertos.h already
 * takes. Port code includes this. Only the shared sources -- which live in the
 * Zephyr tree and are compiled unmodified -- reach the Zephyr spelling, and they
 * do it through the shim's include path. That keeps every file under
 * ports/freertos-nrf52833/ free of Zephyr includes, which is a property worth
 * having for its own sake and which the purity guard enforces.
 *
 * The backend is a fixed path table over the port's uint16_t key-value store:
 * see the .c for why it is a table rather than a hash, and why an unknown path
 * is refused rather than reported as "nothing stored".
