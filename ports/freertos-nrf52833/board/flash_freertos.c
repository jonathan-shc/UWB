/*
 * Internal flash on NVMC, arbitrated against the radio with MPSL timeslots.
 *
 * Programming this flash stalls the CPU. A word write is tens of microseconds
 * and a page erase is 89.7 ms, which is longer than MPSL will ever hand out in
 * one piece, so an operation issued while the radio is scheduled would overrun
 * a radio event. With the radio down there is nothing to arbitrate and the work
 * is done directly; with it up the work is cut into pieces and each piece runs
 * inside a timeslot.
 *
 * A write fills as much of its slot as it measures room for. An erase uses the
 * controller's partial-erase mode, which lets a page be erased in fixed slices
 * with the CPU free between them: 89.7 ms of erasing in 3 ms pieces, thirty of
 * them, rather than one stall that would drop a BLE connection.
 *
 * Two things differ from Nordic's own Zephyr driver, deliberately. It gives a
 * kernel semaphore from inside the timeslot callback; this port does not,
 * because that callback runs at interrupt priority zero and FreeRTOS forbids
 * its API above configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY. The callback here touches
 * only NVMC and a flag, and the calling task polls that flag. Flash operations
 * are rare and already tens of milliseconds, so a one-tick poll costs nothing
 * and removes the question rather than reasoning about it.
 *
 * Writes and erases are confined to a window that excludes the application
 * image. A store with an offset bug can then lose its own data but cannot erase
 * the firmware out from under a door lock.

 *   E reader identity NOT stored (-4)

 * keep, removed the fabric and reported "unable to add accessory". Writes
 * before and after it succeeded, which is what makes an unserialised race look
 * like flaky hardware.
 *
