 * The over-the-air update channel on NimBLE: a second L2CAP CoC, the same
 * frames over GATT, and the button that opens the window.
 *
 * Byte-for-byte the wire protocol of ports/zephyr/dfu/dfu_ble_zephyr.c -- same
 * PSM, same MTU, same two 128-bit UUIDs, same frames -- and that is the point.
 * scripts/cdk-dfu.sh and scripts/ultrawidelock_push.py drive a board without asking which
 * RTOS is on it, and an update path that needed its own tooling would be a
 * second update path to keep working.
 *
 * WHY NOT mcumgr, from the Zephyr side and still true here: SMP-over-BT costs
 * RAM this image does not have, and its permission model either demands pairing
 * (the walk-up unlock depends on never asking) or hands an unauthenticated peer
 * flash writes and a reset command. So the patch rides the CoC transport this
 * board already has, on its own PSM, and authorization is a WINDOW, not a
 * handshake. The window is only a denial-of-service control: the patch header
 * is signed and checked in dfu_receiver.c, and MCUboot re-verifies the patched
 * RESULT, so no peer can install code -- a closed channel just stops strangers
 * spending erase cycles.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE. The Zephyr file also names Apple Home's "Turn On Pairing
 * Mode" as the primary way in, because modules/ultrawidelock_matter opens this window
 * alongside the commissioning one. This port has no Matter layer yet, so SW2 is
 * currently the only way in rather than the local override it is meant to be.
 * ultrawidelock_dfu_window_open() is public, and the Matter tranche will call it from the
 * same place the Zephyr one does.

 * only cross-platform option -- wraps neither. So a bench tool on a Mac cannot
 * drive the CoC at all, and an update path nobody can invoke is not one.
 *
 * This costs almost nothing because the receiver was written transport-blind:
 * both paths hand the same bytes to ultrawidelock_dfu_rx_frame() and neither knows the
 * other exists.
 *
 * ONE HONEST DIFFERENCE, unchanged from the Zephyr port. The CoC refuses the
 * connection outright when no window is open, so none of the receiver's state
 * is reachable. A GATT write always reaches the handler and is refused inside
 * it, with ULTRAWIDELOCK_DFU_ERR_CLOSED. That is a weaker gate, but the work it costs is
 * a comparison and a two-byte notification -- no flash, no allocation -- so a
 * peer spamming it achieves nothing it could not achieve by spamming any other
