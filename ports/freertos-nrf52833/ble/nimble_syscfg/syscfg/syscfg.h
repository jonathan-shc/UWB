 * NimBLE configuration for this product.

 * NimBLE resolves every setting through MYNEWT_VAL(), and upstream's
 * porting/nimble/include/syscfg/syscfg.h guards all 1500-odd defaults with
 * #ifndef. This header therefore only states the values that must differ, then
 * chains to upstream for the rest, so the vendor tree is neither copied nor
 * patched. Put this directory ahead of upstream's on the include path.
 *
 * Every role setting below has to agree with the controller features that
 * radio/radio_start_freertos.c links with sdc_support_*. Enabling a role here
 * that the controller does not support would make NimBLE issue commands the
 * controller rejects at runtime instead of failing at build time.

 * Privacy has no setting here to turn off: NimBLE selects it per call through

/*
 * No isochronous buffers. Upstream defaults these to ten blocks in each
 * direction at 300 bytes, and the transport pool allocates them unconditionally
 * whether or not anything can use them.
 *
 * Nothing here can. ble/nimble_sdc_transport.c rejects ISO packets outright,
 * the controller does not link an isochronous feature, and the product needs
 * GATT and credit-based L2CAP rather than LE Audio. The first target link
 * measured the cost at 3,480 bytes of RAM, which is worth naming in a budget
 * where the Zephyr oracle overflows 128 KB by 1,752.
