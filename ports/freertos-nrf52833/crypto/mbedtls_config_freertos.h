/*
 * Mbed TLS build configuration for the standalone nRF52833 port.
 *
 * This is a whole replacement for mbedtls_config.h, passed as
 * MBEDTLS_CONFIG_FILE, so anything not named here is off. That is the point:
 * the default config enables TLS, X.509 and a filesystem, none of which this
 * image has any caller for.
 *
 * What gets built is the PSA crypto core and nothing else. The legacy modules
 * (ECP, AES, GCM, SHA-256, CMAC, the bignum layer) are NOT listed below and
 * must not be: with MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG on, include/mbedtls/
 * config_adjust_legacy_from_psa.h derives exactly the legacy set that the
 * PSA_WANT_* list in psa_crypto_config_freertos.h requires. Enabling them by
 * hand here would let the two lists drift apart silently.
 *
 * There is no hardware accelerator on this part. nRF52833 has no CryptoCell,
 * so P-256 is software, and a signature or an ECDH agreement costs tens of
 * milliseconds. That is affordable because Aliro's expedited path uses
 * Kpersistent with AES-CMAC and does no asymmetric work inside the
 * ~1.836 ms DW3110 response-arm window; the public-key work happens during
 * the BLE exchange that precedes ranging. Nordic's nrf_oberon would be faster
 * and carries no licence cost this port does not already pay, but binding it
 * under the PSA core is nrf_security's job and nrf_security is Zephyr Kconfig,
 * so it stays out until something is measured to need it.
