# bootstrap.sh — build a self-contained west workspace, PRISTINE from upstream.
#
# Fetches everything the build needs from public GitHub into ./workspace
# (git-ignored), then applies our integration patches on top. It never reads from
# any other local checkout — a clean upstream fetch every time.
#
# Fetches (all public):
#   - Nordic add-on  ncs-door-lock-and-access-control @ the pin below
#   - NCS v3.3.0 + Zephyr + every module (via the add-on's own west manifest)
#
# Prereq (once per machine): nRF Connect SDK v3.3.0 toolchain
#   nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain install --ncs-version v3.3.0
#
# Usage:  ./bootstrap.sh                       # workspace in ./workspace
#         ALIRO_WS=/big/disk/ws ./bootstrap.sh # put the multi-GB workspace elsewhere
