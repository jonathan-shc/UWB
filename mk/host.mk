##@ Test
## test: run the host test suite for our logic  (no NCS toolchain / hardware)
test:
	@$(REPO_ROOT)/tests/host/run.sh

## sdk-check: install the CMake package and build an external C consumer
sdk-check:
	@$(REPO_ROOT)/tests/sdk/run.sh

## sdk-export: the hardware-agnostic SDK as a versioned tarball  ->  build/sdk-export
sdk-export:
	@$(REPO_ROOT)/scripts/sdk-export.sh

## test-san: host suite rebuilt under ASan + UBSan  ·  memory-bug gate
test-san:
	@SAN=1 $(REPO_ROOT)/tests/host/run.sh

## coverage: line coverage of every host suite, 0% rows for the rest  ->  table + HTML
coverage:
	@$(REPO_ROOT)/tests/host/coverage.sh

## cbmc: bounded model-check the wire parsers  ·  memory-safety proof
cbmc:
	@$(REPO_ROOT)/tests/host/cbmc.sh

## check: every host-side suite under one banner  ->  live rows + summary table
check:
	@$(REPO_ROOT)/scripts/test-runner.sh

## drift: constants and integration patch-state identity stay exact
drift:
	@$(REPO_ROOT)/tests/tooling/drift_suite.sh

## ci: every pull-request gate, in the order CI runs them  ·  run before opening one
##   .github/workflows/ci.yml runs this target rather than listing the gates
##   again, so what a pull request is judged by and what this prints cannot
##   drift apart. Cheapest first: a drifted constant fails in a second instead
##   of after two minutes of C suites.
##
##   The secret scan is the one difference. CI gives it its own job because it
##   needs the whole history; here it runs against your checkout when gitleaks
##   is installed, and says so loudly when it is not, because a skipped scan
##   that looks like a pass is worse than no scan.
