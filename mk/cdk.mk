# Bare `build`, `flash`, `flash-erase` and `monitor` all mean this board and,
# unless you say otherwise, its Matter-over-Thread image. The standalone reader
# and the UWB self-test are the special cases and each keeps its own build
# directory, so no target can flash one image and then decode RTT against
# another's ELF.
#
# The app lives under apps/ rather than ports/: it is a product, not an OS
# backend.

# Sysbuild names each image after the application directory, so the per-image
# artifacts live under <build>/dwm3001cdk-lock. Named once here because three targets
# reach into it and a wrong guess fails as "no ELF", which reads like a dead board.

# WHICH DEBUG PROBE, and why this is not a preference. Empty means "let the tool
# pick", which is right with one probe attached and unsafe with two: probe
# enumeration order is NOT stable across replugs, so index 0 is a different board
# from one session to the next.
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-03. Two J-Links attached. `probe-rs list` returned them in one
# order at 15:53 and the reverse order at 16:13, with no cable touched in
# between. `make monitor` took index 0 both times and the second attempt died
# with "Target device responded with a FAULT response to the request" -- which
# reads like a dead board, not the wrong one. The flash targets would have
# written the other part and said nothing at all.
#
# Defaults to PROBE_RS_PROBE, so the variable probe-rs already documents covers

# winner's triple in the cache below, so the identification runs once per
# bench, not per flash. New caches live beside the app's ignored key; an old
# root-level cache remains readable so this move does not lose the probe choice.

# RELEASE=1 appends the release overlay, which trades the 8 KB RTT ring for
# 7,168 B of RAM. Semicolon because EXTRA_CONF_FILE is a CMake list and later
# files win, so this can only ever override overlay-thread.conf. Note `-p auto`
# does NOT re-run CMake when these -D flags change (see CDK_PRISTINE above), so
# switching RELEASE on or off in an existing build dir needs PRISTINE=1.
#
# LTO IS ON BY DEFAULT. `LTO=0` (also n/no/off) opts out, which is what you want
# when a stack trace has to name every frame.
#
# It was gated behind a walk-up unlock on hardware, because a size number cannot
# vouch for the ~1836 us ranging arm deadline under whole-program codegen. That
# gate passed 2026-08-02: two grants, a relock at 336 cm, a re-grant on the
# return leg at 45 cm, 604 RX with the STS live throughout.
#
# Applied to BOTH variants on purpose. Debug and release then differ only in the
# RTT ring size (8 KB vs 1 KB) and the log level (3 vs 1), their codegen is
# identical, and what you debug on the bench is what ships -- which matters most
# for exactly the timing bugs LTO could cause. RELEASE stays what it already
# claims to be: primarily a RAM lever (7,168 B from the RTT ring) plus a flash
# lever (20,568 B from errors-only logging), not a codegen one.
# Worth 41,084 B of flash. See apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/overlay-lto.conf.
#
# SMP=1 adds mcumgr over Bluetooth, which is what nRF Device Manager and nRF
# Connect for iOS speak. After errors-only logging and standalone OpenThread,
# debug+SMP leaves 12,764 B free, so RELEASE=1 is no longer required to fit.
# RELEASE=1 remains the shipping configuration. See apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/overlay-smp.conf
# for the measurements and the security note about the unpaired write endpoint.
# Ordered after overlay-release.conf so nothing it sets can be undone by it.
# OTLOG=1 turns OpenThread's own logging on, which is off by construction
# everywhere else: the level Kconfig depends on OPENTHREAD_DEBUG, so with debug
# off it falls through to 0 and the stack is silent no matter what
# CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL says. Diagnosis only, never shipped, and it may not
# fit -- see apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/overlay-otlog.conf. Last in the list so nothing undoes it.
#
# The LTO default is resolved HERE rather than assigned with `LTO ?= 1`, because

# itself. $(origin) distinguishes "user said nothing" from an explicit LTO=1, so

# ---- image signing -----------------------------------------------------------
# Which private key signs the image is the whole answer to "what will this lock
# boot", so it is never left to MCUboot's default -- that default is a key
# published in MCUboot's own repository. apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/sysbuild.cmake refuses to
# build with any of the seven.
#
# SIGN_KEY (top-level Makefile) is the checkout-wide default, shared with the
# nRF5340 DK, which signs with the same key for the same reason. CDK_KEY is kept
# as the per-build override because `make release` uses it to point one build at
# a production key without disturbing the checkout default.
#
# The path MUST be absolute. Sysbuild hands this symbol to the bootloader image
# through set_config_string(), never through a .conf file, so MCUboot's own
# base-directory search finds nothing and a relative path falls through to
# ${MCUBOOT_DIR}/<path> -- resolving INSIDE the MCUboot repo, which is how a
# wrong path turns silently back into the demo key.
#
# The inner quotes are part of the value: zephyr/cmake/modules/kconfig.cmake:264
# writes a command-line cache variable through verbatim, and a Kconfig string
# without quotes is a syntax error rather than a fallback.
#
# Applied to all three images. `-p auto` does NOT re-run CMake when a -D flag
# changes (see CDK_PRISTINE), so pointing an existing build dir at a new key
# needs PRISTINE=1.

# ---- delta update over BLE ---------------------------------------------------
# modules/ultrawidelock_dfu has to reach BOTH images, and they need opposite halves of it:
# the patch APPLIER is compiled into MCUboot, because an application cannot
# rewrite the flash it is executing from, and the RECEIVER is compiled into the
# application, because the bootloader has no radio.
#
# So EXTRA_ZEPHYR_MODULES is set at the SYSBUILD level and not in
# apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/CMakeLists.txt, whose ZEPHYR_EXTRA_MODULES list is read only by the
# application image -- the bootloader would never see the module at all. What
# carries it across is that sysbuild copies every one of its own cache variables
# into each image's cache file (sysbuild_extensions.cmake:133-147), which is the
# same route NCS uses to get its MCUboot hooks compiled
# (nrf/modules/mcuboot/hooks/).
#
# The two CONFIG_ assignments are per-image and must not be swapped: each half
# is inert without a partition and a peer that the other image owns.
# ULTRAWIDELOCK_DFU_KEY is the IMAGE-signing key, deliberately. The application checks a
# staged update against its public half, so one secret authorises both what the
# bootloader will boot and what the radio will accept, and they cannot drift.

# Not on by default and not a size trim: MCUboot here has no LOG, no PRINTK and
# no RTT at all (apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/sysbuild/mcuboot.conf costs each one), and this turns
# three of them back on. Worth it exactly when the difference between "declined
# the patch" and "applied it and produced an image that fails validation" has to
# be visible, because from the outside those look identical -- both leave an
# erased staging partition and a board that does not run the new firmware.
#
# Read it with MCUboot's OWN elf, not the application's:
#   probe-rs attach --chip nRF52833_xxAA build/<dir>/mcuboot/zephyr/zephyr.elf
# The application re-initialises the RTT control block on every boot
# (CONFIG_SEGGER_RTT_INIT_MODE_ALWAYS in prj.conf, and it has to), so anything
# the bootloader printed is gone the moment the application starts.

# under different signatures, 64 bytes apart at the end. Only the .hex reaches

# `cdk-size` only ever reports, `cdk-size-check` is the only one that can fail.

# CDK_SIZE_REPORTS=0 skips Zephyr's ram_report/rom_report. They are the numbers
# the RAM work in this repo already quotes, so they are on by default, but they
# cost ~73 s (measured, this image), they need the toolchain, and they are a
