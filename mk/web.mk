# mk/web.mk — the site: landing page, guides, flasher, twin, subsystem graph.
#
# This is not the `make docs` that was removed. That one shelled out to a page
# generator living outside the repository, wrote a page per source file into
# docs/, and committed all 476 of them; every merge then conflicted on derived
# line numbers, which is why it needed a `make sync` whose own comment admitted
# only a regeneration could fix them.
#
# Nothing here is committed. web/dist/ is gitignored and disposable, the
# generator is stdlib Python in this repository, and the whole site builds with
# no toolchain, no node and nothing installed.
#
# Four optional inputs, each degrading rather than failing:
#   emcc                                  the twin's simulator
#   graphify-out/graph.json               fresher file-level graph data; without
#                                         it both graph pages still build, from
#                                         the committed web/graph/subsystems.json
#                                         and web/graph/files.json
#   web/vendor/3d-force-graph.min.js      3D rather than the flat SVG graph
#   build/esp32-matter-lock-*/*.bin       the flasher's images; without them
#                                         the page says so instead of offering
#                                         a button that downloads nothing

# Auto-provisioning, used by `docs` and deliberately NOT by `docs-check`.
#
# `docs` is what a person runs, and it should produce the best site this
# machine can make -- so it offers to fetch the two things the repository does
# not carry. `docs-check` is the gate CI runs. It stays hermetic and offline:
# a gate that reaches the network can fail for reasons that have nothing to do
# with the change being gated, and CI has no terminal to answer a prompt.
#
# Nothing is installed or downloaded without being asked first, and declining
# is a normal answer -- build.py degrades every one of these to something
# honest. Two escape hatches:
#
#   DOCS_AUTO=1   yes to everything, no prompts   (scripts, first-run setup)
#   DOCS_AUTO=0   no to everything, no prompts    (offline, or just quiet)
#
# With no answer possible (stdin is not a terminal) the default is no.

##@ Docs
## docs: build the website  ->  web/dist/index.html
##   Landing page, the guides under docs/, the flasher, the twin and the graph.
##   Offers to fetch the 3D graph renderer and to install/refresh graphify.
##   DOCS_AUTO=1 to accept without asking, DOCS_AUTO=0 to skip it all.
docs: docs-deps

## docs-check: build the website and fail on any dead internal link
##   Hermetic: never fetches, never installs, never prompts. This is the CI gate.

## docs-graph-refresh: rewrite the committed graph data from graphify-out/
##   Two files, both written by this target: the 4 KB web/graph/subsystems.json
##   the flat page draws, and the 680 KB web/graph/files.json the 3D page flies
##   through. They are the only graph data a fresh clone or CI has, so they have
##   to be refreshed by hand and committed. This is deliberately
##   not part of `docs`: rewriting it on every build left a dirty tree in each
##   worktree that had graphify data, and its first line is the commit the
##   graph was extracted at, so two branches that both built conflicted there
##   on every merge. Run this, read the diff, commit it on its own.
##
##   Needs graphify-out/graph.json  (`graphify update .`); without it the
##   build says so and leaves the committed file untouched.

## docs-graph3d: vendor the 3D graph renderer
##   The one thing the 3D graph needs that is deliberately not in the tree:
##
##     web/vendor/3d-force-graph.min.js   1.3 MB of three.js and d3-force-3d.
##                                        A third-party bundle; gitignored.
##
##   Its data is committed as web/graph/files.json, so this is all a fresh
##   clone needs. The pages workflow runs this target for the same reason.
##   Without the renderer the build says so and falls back to the flat graph,
##   which is always correct and never a dead link.
##
##   `graphify update .` is still worth running before a refresh: it rewrites
##   graphify-out/graph.json, which is where both committed files come from.

## release-all: build every publishable image, then the site around them
##   The three release bundles plus a site whose flasher actually carries
##   firmware. Building and publishing a release stays entirely local: run it,
##   check the bundles under build/release/, push, then attach them with
##   `gh release create vN.N.N build/release/*/*.bin ...`.
##
##   The one exception is the website. .github/workflows/pages.yml renders and
##   deploys it, because publishing to Pages is the only step a laptop cannot
##   do. It is workflow_dispatch only -- nothing here happens on a push -- and
##   it fetches the firmware above from the latest release rather than building
##   any, so the site is only as current as the last release plus the last time
##   someone ran it.

##   Deliberately not the dev key `make dfu-key` writes.
