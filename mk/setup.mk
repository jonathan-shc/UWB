## bootstrap: set this machine up for the repo  ·  the only command before build
##   Checks the host first, then installs the NCS toolchain and fetches the
##   workspace. Interrupt it whenever: every phase resumes on the next run.
##   In a linked worktree with no ./workspace yet, this delegates to ws-seed: a COW
##   clone of the primary's tree costs ~0 disk, where refetching costs 6.5 GB.
##   Options: NO_SEED=1 in a worktree, fetch a full independent workspace anyway
##            SETUP_AUTO=1 install missing nrfutil without asking (0 = never ask)

## ws-seed: give THIS worktree its own workspace (APFS COW clone, ~0 disk)
##   Idempotent. Isolates worktrees so branch-bouncing can't build stale patches.

##   that has it: scripts/ws-seed.sh <path-to-worktree>
