"""cdk-size.py — what the DWM3001CDK image costs, as a machine-readable record.

The CDK image is the constrained one: reader, DW3110 ranging, a hand-written
Matter node and an OpenThread MTD on a 128 KB-RAM nRF52833. RAM is the scarcest
resource in the project and the one most easily spent by accident, so this reads
an already-built tree and says how much of each region is left.

    scripts/cdk-size.py --build build/cdk-matter
    scripts/cdk-size.py --build build/cdk-matter --json out.json
    make cdk-size

FREE BYTES, NOT PERCENTAGES. At 97% of 128 KB a 644 B regression moves the
percentage by half a point and reads as noise; "3,891 B free" does not.

NO TOOLCHAIN REQUIRED for the headline numbers. The ELF is parsed here rather
than shelled out to arm-none-eabi-size/nm, for the same reason objcopy is
avoided: those binaries live inside the NCS toolchain, so requiring
them turns "the gate ran" into "the gate ran if you had bootstrapped". Zephyr's
own ram_report/rom_report DO need the toolchain and are folded in when they are
available (--reports), as a cross-check rather than as the only source.

REGION SIZES COME FROM THE BUILD. Origin and length are read out of the linker's
own Memory Configuration block in zephyr.map, and the partition layout out of
partitions.yml, so a pm_static change moves these numbers instead of silently
invalidating a datasheet constant hardcoded here.

Exit 0 on a report, 2 when there is no build tree to measure. Measuring is all
this does: scripts/cdk-size-compare.py is what fails a build.

#   sections  SHF_ALLOC section headers bucketed by address, which is what
#             `arm-none-eabi-size -A` shows.
#
# SUMMING SECTION SIZES IS THE WRONG ANSWER, and establishing that took checking
# against two real links rather than reasoning about it. ld reports
# `region->current - region->origin`: how far the placement pointer advanced,
# which INCLUDES the alignment padding between sections. So the figure is the
# span from the region origin to the highest byte placed, not the sum of what
# was placed. On this build's MCUboot image the two differ by 4 B (19,968
# against 19,964), which is padding between `device_states` and `bss`; on the
# application image by 6,676 B, which is the .data load image plus padding.
#
# max(filesz, memsz) FOR THE LOAD VIEW is the other half of the agreement.
# .ramfunc is SHT_NOBITS on the application image -- an empty reserved 8 B
# window with filesz 0 -- and ld still charges those 8 B to FLASH, because the
# section is placed `> RAM AT> FLASH`. Using filesz alone came out 8 B under.
#
# A segment's run address and its load address are charged separately, which is
# how .data is counted against RAM where it lives AND against FLASH where its
# initialiser image is stored. Both are real occupancy.
#
# VERIFIED AGAINST THE LINKER, all four regions of both images of one build,
# exact to the byte:
#   application  FLASH 410,640   RAM 124,564
#   MCUboot      FLASH  32,928   RAM  19,968
# tests/tooling/cdk_size_test.sh re-checks this against a recorded fixture, so a
# change here that stops reproducing ld is a test failure rather than a quietly
# wrong gate.
