#
# The sibling of scripts/bootstrap.sh, which does the same job for the two
# Zephyr ports. They share scripts/lib/setup.sh, so both stop, ask and resume
# the same way; what differs is only what gets installed.
#
# Two stages, because the disk costs differ by an order of magnitude and
# docs/porting-esp32.md already tells people to stage it this way:
#
#   1. ESP-IDF          about 5 GB   enough for APP=reader, satellite, initiator
#   2. esp-matter       about 15 GB  additionally needed by APP=matter-lock
#
# Nothing is downloaded without being asked first (SETUP_AUTO=1 answers yes,
# SETUP_AUTO=0 answers no), and both stages are idempotent: an existing install
# is re-pinned and reused rather than refetched.
#
# Usage:  make esp-bootstrap                    # stage 2 too, because APP defaults to matter-lock
#         make esp-bootstrap APP=reader         # stage 1 only
#         make esp-bootstrap ESP_MATTER=1       # force stage 2 for any APP
#
# Everything below is overridable, and the two paths deliberately come from the
# same variables mk/esp32.mk builds with — so what this installs is what the
# build looks for, and there is no third place for them to disagree.
