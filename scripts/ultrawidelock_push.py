"""Push a signed delta patch to a DWM3001CDK over Bluetooth.

    scripts/ultrawidelock_push.py update.wdfu

The board accepts nothing until an update window is open, so this connects and
then WAITS, asking once a second and prompting you to press SW2. The window
lasts CONFIG_ULTRAWIDELOCK_DFU_WINDOW_MS, five minutes by default. Start the push first
or press the button first; either order works.

On success the board reboots into MCUboot, which applies the patch -- about
30 seconds during which it is not on the air. The Bluetooth connection dropping
right after COMMIT is the expected ending, not a failure.

Needs bleak:

    python3 -m pip install bleak

WHY GATT AND NOT THE L2CAP CoC the firmware also offers: no Python Bluetooth
library can open an L2CAP connection-oriented channel. CoreBluetooth and BlueZ
both can, bleak wraps neither, and bleak is the only cross-platform option. The
firmware carries both transports for exactly this reason; an iPhone app would
use the CoC and get better throughput.
