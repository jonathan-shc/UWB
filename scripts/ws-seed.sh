#
# Frequent branch-bouncing over a single shared workspace is a trap: the tree
# holds one patch state at a time (last bootstrap wins), so a build from the
# wrong worktree silently compiles another branch's patches. This seeds a
# per-worktree workspace at the default path ($TREE/workspace) so build.sh picks
# it up with no env var, and each worktree stays self-contained.
#
# Cheap because it uses an APFS copy-on-write clone (cp -c): the clone shares
# every block with the primary and costs ~0 extra disk until a patched file
# diverges. Cleanup is automatic — the workspace lives inside the worktree, so
# deleting the worktree deletes it (see `make ws-clean`).
