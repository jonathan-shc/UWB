# check-signing-key.sh — refuse to build a bootloader that anybody can sign for.
#
# WHAT IS BEING PREVENTED. MCUboot boots slot 0 only if the image verifies
# against a public key compiled into the bootloader, so the private half is the
# whole answer to "what firmware will this lock run". Configure nothing and
# MCUboot signs with root-ec-p256.pem out of its OWN repository, where that key
# is published. Every stock MCUboot in the world accepts images signed with it.
# On a lock that is not a signing key, it is a formality.
#
# MCUboot does notice, at bootloader/mcuboot/boot/zephyr/CMakeLists.txt:449-452,
# and calls message(WARNING). That is precisely why it survived on this port for
# as long as it did: a warning in a ten-thousand-line build log is
# indistinguishable from no warning. Here it is fatal.
#
#   scripts/check-signing-key.sh <path>      # validate one configured key
#   scripts/check-signing-key.sh --self-test # prove the refusals actually fire
#
# Exit 0 clean, 1 on a finding, 2 if the gate could not do its job.
#
# Both Zephyr ports call this, which is why it is a file rather than a paragraph
# repeated in each: firmware/sysbuild.cmake for the DWM3001CDK, and
# scripts/build-nrf5340dk.sh for the nRF5340 DK. One list, one set of refusals,
# one place to edit when upstream adds an eighth demo key. The DK additionally
# reads the key back out of the built mcuboot .config, because a flag we passed
# is not the same fact as a flag the build honoured.
