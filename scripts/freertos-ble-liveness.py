"""freertos-ble-liveness.py — judge a running FreeRTOS lock over the air.

Usage:
    scripts/freertos-ble-liveness.py            # all three checks
    scripts/freertos-ble-liveness.py --scan     # advertisement only

Needs bleak (pip install bleak) and a host BLE radio. Exit: 0 pass, 1 a check
failed, 2 the board was never found.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and why a boot log is not enough.

This port has twice printed a complete, healthy boot log from a board that was
already dead: once when the kernel tick armed an RTC compare it could never
match, and once when a %lld reached newlib-nano's printf, bus-faulted on the
%s after it, and spun default_handler with the tick stopped. Both times every
line up to the fault was correct and every line after it simply never came.
RTT makes that worse rather than better -- the up-buffer skips writes when it
is full, so the boot lines survive and the periodic ones vanish, which looks
identical to a board that stopped.

So these checks are all things a stopped board cannot fake. Advertising needs
the controller scheduling events; a connection needs the host task servicing
them; a GATT reply needs the ATT server running on the work queue. None of it
survives a hung tick.

The DFU check is the one worth keeping honest about scope. It proves the
window gate refuses -- not that an update works. Driving a real update needs
the L2CAP CoC, and no cross-platform Python library opens one.
