"""cdk-size-compare.py — head against the recorded baseline, as a gate.

    scripts/cdk-size-compare.py --baseline apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/size-baseline.json \
                                --current build/cdk-matter/size-report.json
    make cdk-size-check

Exit 0 when the image still fits with room to spare, 1 on a floor or cap
violation, 2 when there is nothing to compare, and 3 when the two reports were
not built the same way.

THREE IS NOT A SOFTER ONE. A size delta measured across a toolchain bump, an
overlay change or an LTO flip is not a delta: LTO alone is worth 41,084 B of
flash on this image (mk/cdk.mk), which would swamp every real signal in either
direction. So a configuration difference REFUSES TO PRODUCE A NUMBER rather
than producing a misleading one, and the fix is to refresh the baseline, not to
widen the cap.

THE FLOOR IS THE GATE, and it is expressed in free bytes. The CDK image runs at
roughly 95% of a 128 KB part, where a 644 B regression moves the percentage by
half a point and reads as rounding. Percentages are printed for orientation and
nothing is decided on them.

TOP MOVERS ARE A DIAGNOSTIC AND NEVER FAIL A BUILD. Under LTO the symbol names
are not stable across builds (see normalise_symbol in cdk-size.py), so the
attribution below is indicative: it tells you where to look, not what happened.

# ---- which recorded configuration this build is ------------------------------
# THE BASELINE HOLDS MORE THAN ONE, because more than one is a real build. The
# shipping image is SMP=1 RELEASE=1 with LTO on -- what `make release` and
# `make fota` produce (mk/cdk.mk:564) -- and it is the one that has to fit a
# customer's board, so it is the one CI gates. But bare `make build` is what a
# contributor runs all day, and if the only record were the shipping one their
# local check would refuse to say anything at all. Both are recorded, keyed by
# the overlay set that distinguishes them, and each is only ever compared
# against itself.
#
# RELEASE and SMP are not small: RELEASE gives up the 8 KB RTT ring for 7,168 B
# of RAM and SMP costs 3,712 B for mcumgr, so the two images differ by thousands
# of bytes of headroom in opposite directions. One record covering both would be
# a number that describes neither.


# Imported rather than re-implemented: cdk-size.py writes the reports, so it
# owns what names a configuration. Two copies of this would drift into a
# baseline recorded under one key and looked up under another, which reads as
# "no baseline for this configuration" and is very hard to see.
