"""cdk-size-baseline.py — turn a size report into the committed baseline.

    scripts/cdk-size-baseline.py --from build/cdk-matter/size-report.json \

Two things happen here and both matter.

VOLATILE FIELDS ARE DROPPED. A timestamp and a build directory change on every
run, so carrying them would make the committed file churn on every refresh and
bury the numbers that actually moved in a diff nobody reads. The commit is kept:
it is what makes the record auditable.

THE GATE SETTINGS SURVIVE A REFRESH. Floor and cap are a decision about how much
headroom this board must keep, not a measurement, so re-recording the numbers
must not quietly reset them -- which is exactly how a floor ratchets down to
meet whatever the image happens to weigh today. They are only ever changed by
editing the file or passing them here explicitly.

# THE CONFIGURATION THE GATE TRACKS is the one that ships: SMP=1 RELEASE=1 with

# fota` pushes over Bluetooth. That image is the one that has to fit a board in
# somebody's door, so it is the one whose headroom is worth blocking a merge
# over. Bare `make build` -- the debug image, 8 KB of RTT ring and no mcumgr --
# is recorded too, because it is what a contributor measures locally, but it is
# a different build with a different budget and is never compared to this one.

# 4,096 B of free RAM is one page and roughly two thread stacks' worth of slack
# on this image; below that a walk-up unlock is one unlucky allocation from
# failing. 2,048 B per pull request is about a quarter of the remaining RAM
# headroom, which is large enough not to trip on ordinary work and small enough
# that spending the rest takes a conversation.
#
# The caps are sized as a share of what is left rather than picked round, and on
# the shipping image the binding region is FLASH (16,356 B free) and not RAM
# (9,836 B free) -- the reverse of the debug build, because the 8 KB RTT ring
# RELEASE gives up is RAM. An 8,192 B flash cap would have let one pull request
# spend half the remaining flash, so it is 4,096 B: about a quarter of the
# headroom, matching what 2,048 B is to RAM.
