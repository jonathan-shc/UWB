# The shared Matter Thread transport is compiled unmodified. Assert it still
# fits the shim that carries it.
#
# ports/zephyr/matter/matter_thread_port.c is built into this image as-is,
# against ports/freertos-nrf52833/matter/matter_compat. That works because its
# Zephyr surface is small and fixed. Nothing enforces that on the other side:
# the file belongs to the Zephyr build, and a change there compiles fine THERE.
#
# Two ways it can break this image, and both are quiet:
#
#   1. It starts using a Zephyr facility the shim does not provide. That is a
#      compile error, which is loud, so it is not what this file is for.
#   2. It renames the settings path. The shim's table then has no entry, the
#      backend refuses at RUN TIME on a board, and the only symptom is an SRP
#      host name that changes every boot -- which presents as a node that
#      attaches to Thread and never registers.
#
# The second is what this checks, plus the openthread_*() set, because a new
# helper would compile only if it happened to match something already declared.
