# for both Zephyr ports) and scripts/esp-bootstrap.sh (ESP-IDF and esp-matter).
#
# It carries no knowledge of either SDK. What it owns is the dialect both of
# them speak, because the thing a setup script is really for is telling a
# stranger's machine what it is missing — and two scripts that answer that
# question in two different voices are two scripts to learn instead of one.

# The rules it enforces, both learned from the shape of the old failures:
#
#   * Report every miss in one pass. Stopping at the first one turns a single
