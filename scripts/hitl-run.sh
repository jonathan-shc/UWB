#!/usr/bin/env bash
# hitl-run.sh — one unattended pass of the DK-as-iPhone loop: enrol the
# initiator against the live reader, build it, flash it, and judge the result
# off what both boards actually say.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/hitl-run.sh                       # the whole loop
#   scripts/hitl-run.sh --skip-enrol          # reuse src/bench_identity.h as-is
#   scripts/hitl-run.sh --skip-enrol --skip-build --skip-flash
#                                             # judge the boards as they run now
#   TIMEOUT=180 scripts/hitl-run.sh           # give the verdict window longer
#   PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX scripts/hitl-run.sh   # name the DK console port
#
# Options:
#   --skip-enrol   keep the existing bench_identity.h. Without this flag a run
#                  MINTS A FRESH CREDENTIAL, which unbinds any DK image built
#                  against the previous header -- that is why --skip-build and
#                  --skip-flash are refused unless enrolment is skipped too:
#                  a fresh credential with a stale board can never pass.
#   --skip-build   do not rebuild the initiator
#   --skip-flash   do not touch the DK (implies the image on it is current)
#   --no-reader    judge from the DK console alone, without the reader's RTT
#   Environment: NODE (0x1234), STORAGE (~/.aliro-chip-tool), FABRIC (alpha),
#                TIMEOUT (verdict window seconds, 120), PORT (DK console)
#
# Exit: 0 PASS · 1 FAIL (verdict window closed without the markers, or a fail
# marker appeared) · 2 a stage refused to run (reason on stderr)
#
# What PASS means, and why these markers:
#   DK console  "=== ESTABLISHED: URSK agreed with the reader ===" -- the whole
#               BLE Access Protocol succeeded against the enrolled identity.
#   DK console  "Pre-POLL #" -- M1..M3 negotiated AND the transmitter armed; a
#               repeating needle on purpose, the 5 Hz cadence outlives the
#               serial capture's occasional byte drops where a one-shot
#               banner did not.
#   reader RTT  "PREPOLL OK" -- the reader DECRYPTED a Pre-POLL whose CCM* MIC
#               is keyed by mUPSK1 from the URSK (ccc_shim_rx.c), so the key the
#               protocol produced is the same key on both ends, on air. This is
#               the one marker a BLE-only fake cannot produce, which is why the
#               reader watch is on by default and --no-reader is the opt-out.
#
# The reader is watched over its J-Link (firmware/keys/cdk-probe) against the
# ELF recorded at deploy time (build/cdk-deployed/zephyr.elf) -- the build tree
# holds the image being built NEXT, not the one running, per mk/cdk.mk.
#
# Artifacts land in build/hitl-run/<timestamp>/: enrol.log, dk-serial.log,
# cdk-rtt.log, verdict.txt. The serial capture starts BEFORE the flash so the
# boot banner and a fast session are never missed.
