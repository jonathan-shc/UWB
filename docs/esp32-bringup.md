# ESP32 bring-up (S3, C5, and C6)

One page, match-the-table. The pin map's source of truth is
`ports/esp32/components/ultrawidelock_uwb/port/board_pins.h`; if you change it there, change it
here.

## 1. Wire the radio

### DWM3000EVB shield

Power the EVB from the ESP32 board's **3V3** pin, not 5 V — the DW3000 is a 3.3 V
part. Share a common ground and USB-power the board during bring-up.

| DWM3000EVB pin | Signal | ESP32-S3 | ESP32-C5 | ESP32-C6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D13 | SCLK | GPIO12 | GPIO8 | GPIO6 |
| D11 | MOSI | GPIO11 | GPIO9 | GPIO7 |
| D12 | MISO | GPIO13 | GPIO23 | GPIO2 |
| D10 | CS | GPIO10 | GPIO10 | GPIO10 |
| D8 | IRQ | GPIO5 | GPIO5 | GPIO3 |
| D7 | RSTn | GPIO4 | GPIO4 | GPIO1 |
| D9 | WAKEUP | GPIO6 | GPIO6 | GPIO0 |
| 3V3 | power | 3V3 | 3V3 | 3V3 |
| GND | ground | GND | GND | GND |
| D1 | SPI-POL | GND (mode-0 strap) | same | same |
| D0 | SPI-PHA | GND (mode-0 strap) | same | same |

Mode-0 strap: the DW3000 SPI must run CPOL=0/CPHA=0. Tie D0 and D1 to GND unless your
EVB revision already fixes the mode on the shield — check the EVB manual before
soldering.

GPIO 4, 5, 6, and 10-13 are clear of the S3's octal PSRAM pins. SPI2 routes
through the GPIO matrix, so the bus can be remapped in `board_pins.h` if your
board does not break these pins out.

Why the C5 data pins differ: on the C5 the S3's GPIO11/12 are the UART0 console and
GPIO13 is USB-Serial-JTAG; GPIO8/9/23 also avoid the strapping pins (2/7/25/27/28,
plus 3/26 per the DevKitC-1 guide) and the GPIO27 RGB LED. The C5 build targets the
4 MB flash floor of the WROOM-1 family (`partitions_4mb.csv`); if your module has
more, raise `CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE` in `sdkconfig.defaults.esp32c5`.

Why the C6 pins differ: GPIO6/7/2 are SPI2's direct IO_MUX
SCLK/MOSI/MISO pins. GPIO10/1/3/0 keep the control signals away from the C6
strapping pins (GPIO4/5/8/9/15), native USB (GPIO12/13), and UART0
(GPIO16/17). The C6 reader and Matter configs target the official
ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1's 8 MB flash.

### BU04 module in direct-SPI mode

The same C6 firmware can drive the DW radio inside a BU04 directly. The onboard
STM32F103 shares the DW SPI and control nets, so connect BU04 pad 2 (`ST_NRST`)
to GND before powering either board and keep it low for the entire session. Do
not release `ST_NRST` while the ESP32 is driving those nets; otherwise both MCUs
can drive the bus.

| BU04 module pad | Signal | ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1 |
|---|---|---|
| 13 `SPI_CLK` | SCLK | GPIO6 |
| 14 `SPI_MOSI` | MOSI | GPIO7 |
| 15 `SPI_MISO` | MISO | GPIO2 |
| 16 `SPI_CSN` | CS | GPIO10 |
| 17 `IRQ` | IRQ | GPIO3 |
| 12 `DW_RSTN` | RSTn | GPIO1 |
| 11 `DW_WAKEUP` | WAKEUP | GPIO0 |
| 20 `GPIO5/SPIPOL` | SPI mode strap | GND |
| 21 `GPIO6/SPIPHA` | SPI mode strap | GND |
| 1 or 10 | ground | GND |
| 23 `VDD1` and 24/34 `3V3` | power domains | regulated 3.3 V |
| 2 `ST_NRST` | hold onboard STM32 in reset | GND for the entire session |

The BU04 specification recommends a 3.3 V supply capable of at least 500 mA.
Do not use 5 V on these module power pins. `DW_RSTN` is open-drain: the ESP
driver only pulls it low and releases it; never add an external pull-up to a
different voltage.

This first image still selects the existing DW3000-family driver profile. On
boot, capture the raw `DEV_ID` line. IDs ending in `...02`/`...12` use the
current profile; `...04`/`...14` require switching the component to its
in-tree DW3720 profile before ranging.

### Check the EVB power-select jumper

Do this before anything else. Correct wiring is not enough if the EVB's own power-select
jumper picks the wrong source: SPI then fails silently, with no valid device ID and a
responder that never listens, and it looks exactly like a software fault. This cost days
of debugging once. Check the jumper first.

## 2. Build and flash

```bash
cd examples/esp32/reader
make set-target TARGET=esp32c6   # or esp32s3 / esp32c5
make build
make flash
make monitor
```

`make set-target` runs `idf.py set-target` once per checkout. ESP-IDF is expected at
`~/esp/esp-idf`; override with `IDF_EXPORT=`. The port is
auto-detected and SEGGER/J-Link ports are refused; `make ports` lists what is attached
and how each is classified.

## 3. What good output looks like

The bench app brings the radio up, binds a canned URSK, and starts the CCC DS-TWR
responder:

    I (xxx) ultrawidelock_esp32: app_responder_start() = 0 (DW3000 up, responder listening)

- `= 0` — SPI, DW3000, and the CCC init path all came up. The engine is talking to the
  chip. With no peer present there are no range lines, which is expected.
- `= <nonzero> (FAILED -- check wiring/SPI)` — the DW3000 did not answer. In order:
  recheck the power-select jumper, then CS/SCLK/MOSI/MISO, then the mode-0 strap, then
  drop to slow-only by setting `ULTRAWIDELOCK_DW3000_SPI_FAST_HZ` to `2000000` in `board_pins.h`.

## 4. Prove a real range

Ranging needs a peer to drive the DS-TWR exchange: an Aliro-capable iPhone with a key
provisioned for this reader, or a second DW3000 board acting as initiator. With a peer,
`range: NN cm` lines appear and `status` reports a trusted range.

For the full approach-unlock path — commissioning, a key in the phone's wallet, and the
Wallet unlock animation — use the Matter app in
[`apps/esp32-matter-lock`](../apps/esp32-matter-lock) instead. This bench
app has no Matter layer, so nothing provisions a real credential into a phone for it.

No antenna calibration was needed on this hardware. If distances come out negative or
absurd, read
[`docs/esp32-gotchas.md`](esp32-gotchas.md) §6.4 before reaching for a
calibration constant — it was a timestamp-pairing bug, not a physical offset.

ESP32-S3 is hardware-validated with the DWM3000EVB. ESP32-C6 is
hardware-validated with the BU04 in direct-SPI mode and `ST_NRST` held low.
ESP32-C5 has build/release support but no recorded hardware validation.
