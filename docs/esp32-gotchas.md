# ESP32-S3 gotchas

Hard-won, non-obvious findings from porting the Aliro UWB door-lock reader to ESP32-S3
(ESP-IDF + esp-matter + NimBLE + DWM3000EVB). Each entry is a trap actually hit on the
bench: what it looks like, why it bites, and how to avoid or apply it.

Ports live under [`ports/esp32`](../ports/esp32) (reader / crypto / BLE components and
the standalone bring-up app) and [`ports/esp32/apps/matter-lock`](../ports/esp32/apps/matter-lock) (the Matter
door-lock app that hosts the reader). The ranging engine is `modules/woz_uwb`, shared
byte-for-byte with the nRF5340 build.

> **Bare `make build`, `make flash` and `make monitor` below are run from inside an app
> directory**, where the local Makefile forwards them to ESP-IDF. At the repository root
> those same names mean the DWM3001CDK; the root spelling is `make esp-build`,
> `make esp-flash` and `make esp-monitor` with `APP=` and `TARGET=`.

> Verification convention below: **VERIFIED** = confirmed on silicon or byte-exact
> against a host KAT; **BENCH-GATED** = built + host-tested but not yet
> confirmed against a live iPhone; **PREDICTED** = derived from vendor source or
> datasheet only, never observed here, so a hazard to measure rather than a finding.

## 1. Toolchain, build & flash

### 1.1 `make flash` aborts with `awk: towc: multibyte conversion failure`
**VERIFIED.** The Makefile classifies USB serial ports by piping `ioreg -l -w0` through
`awk`. Some attached USB device ships a non-UTF-8 string descriptor; under a UTF-8
locale `awk` aborts mid-stream (`towc` conversion), which kills **both** port detection
and the SEGGER/J-Link safety guard — so `make flash` fails with "no ESP serial port
found" even though the board is plugged in.

- **Fix:** prefix the `awk` invocation with `LC_ALL=C` (byte-wise, locale-independent).
- **Subtlety:** `LC_ALL=C ioreg | awk …` does **not** work — the env prefix applies only
  to the first command in the pipeline. It must be `ioreg | LC_ALL=C awk …`.
- Applied at both `awk` sites in `ports/esp32/apps/matter-lock/Makefile` (the RESOLVE_PORT table
  build and the `ports` target).

### 1.2 Never flash the SEGGER/J-Link (nRF) port
**VERIFIED.** With both an nRF5340DK and the ESP32-S3 attached, port auto-detection can
see the J-Link (SEGGER, USB vendor `0x1366`). Flashing esptool to it is wrong and can
disrupt the nRF. The Makefile refuses that vendor and only auto-selects the ESP devkit's
bridges — WCH CH343/CH9102 (`0x1A86`) or Espressif native USB (`0x303A`), both
`/dev/cu.usbmodem…`. `ioreg` reports vendor ids in decimal, which is why the Makefile
compares against `4966` / `6790` / `12346`. Keep the guard; don't bypass it.

### 1.3 `make flash` port-holder guard
`make flash` refuses if another process holds the port (a stuck `monitor`), with a clear
message. Override with `FORCE=1` only after confirming no other session owns the port.
(commit `8ce132a`)

**VERIFIED addendum.** `lsof -t "$port"` silently missed a live `idf.py monitor` on one
Mac, so the guard passed and a `make app-flash` spent a full build before esptool died
on `[Errno 35] Could not exclusively lock port`. The cause was never reproduced, so the
guard no longer relies on naming the holder: when `lsof` finds nothing it also tries to
take the exclusive `flock` that esptool needs, and refuses if that fails. `FORCE=1`
still kills a named PID and now says so plainly when there is a lock but no PID to kill.

### 1.4 A Kconfig `default` does not reach an app that already has an `sdkconfig`
**VERIFIED, and it cost three bench sessions.** Changing `default` in a `Kconfig` only
seeds a **fresh** `sdkconfig`. An app with an existing one keeps its old value forever,
so the build silently ships the previous setting and every measurement after it is
profiling the old firmware.

- **What hid it:** *new* symbols behave the opposite way. They are absent from
  `sdkconfig`, so they do track their Kconfig default. A batch of changes can therefore
  half-apply, which reads as "the config took" when it did not.
- **Fix:** pin anything that matters in `sdkconfig.defaults`, which this repo already
  treats as the tracked source of truth (see the app `.gitignore`), **and** confirm what
  actually shipped before trusting a bench number:
  ```
  grep WOZ_RSSI_GATE ports/esp32/apps/matter-lock/sdkconfig
  ```
- **Do not** just `rm sdkconfig` to force a regeneration unless you know everything you
  need is in `sdkconfig.defaults`; menuconfig-only settings are lost with it.

### 1.5 The apps have incompatible flash layouts, and they share your board
**VERIFIED.** Flashing one app over another leaves a bootloader that cannot find the
next app's partition table, and the board sits in a reset loop reporting
`partition 0 invalid magic number 0xffff`.

| app | flash size | partition table |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/matter-lock` | 4 MB | 0xC000 |
| `apps/initiator` (HIL) | 2 MB | 0x8000 |

- **Tell:** the boot banner's `SPI Flash Size` disagrees with the app you think you
  flashed, and its `compile time` is not your build's.
- **Fix:** a full `make flash`, never `app-flash`. Only the full target rewrites the
  bootloader and partition table together.
- **Related:** the board may physically have more flash than the image header declares
  (16 MB part, 4 MB header). The bootloader honours the header, and the
  `spi_flash: Detected size larger than ... image header` warning is benign.

### 1.6 Host tests are the target's proof
The crypto core (`aliro_hash.c`) compiles **host == target** so host KATs pin target
behaviour. Run `ports/esp32/test/run.sh` before believing any crypto change. A
compact AES-256-GCM host double (`aliro_prim_host.c`) lets the KATs run without PSA.
Build success is not proof: the wire/crypto bugs below all built cleanly. The shared
`modules/woz_uwb` logic has a second host harness, `tests/host/run.sh` (`make test`),
which compiles the shared sources **without** `ESP_PLATFORM`: that is
the proof an ESP-only guard didn't regress the nRF path.

---

## 2. Hardware bring-up

### 2.1 DWM3000 EVB power jumper (the multi-day one)
**VERIFIED.** DW3000 SPI comms silently failed until the EVB power jumper was set
correctly. Symptom before: no valid device ID / responder never listens. After: `start_
aliro()=0`, responder listening, a 36-byte RX frame arrives. If DW3000 bring-up looks
dead, check the **board power-select jumper first** — it is not a software problem.

### 2.2 Probe the DW3000 at boot, never from the BLE-host callback at M4
**VERIFIED (regression) → BENCH-GATED (fix).** The standalone reader app (`ports/esp32/apps/reader`) probes the
DW3000 at boot (`app_responder_start()` in `main.c`). The `matter-lock` app dropped
that, so the first DW3000 touch happened at M4 — inside the NimBLE host callback
(`aliro_ranging_feed → engine → woz_uwb_start_aliro → dwt_probe`). There `dwt_probe`
returns `-1` (radio init `-5`): no prior bring-up + a shallow callback stack. Symptoms:
`dwt_probe failed: -1`, then on reconnect `spi_bus_initialize: SPI bus already
initialized`.

- **Fix:** bring the radio up once in the clean reader-startup task. `aliro_ranging_init`
  does a throwaway `woz_uwb_start_aliro` (zero URSK) + `woz_uwb_stop`; `uwb_min`'s
  `g_radio_ready` latches, so M4's `ccc_prepoll_listen` skips the probe and only
  re-applies the negotiated channel.
- **Corollary bug:** `dw3000_spi_init` re-added SPI devices on a second call (leaking the
  old handles) — made idempotent (`return 0` if already up). The boot probe means M4
  never re-enters `dw3000_hw_init` anyway, so the "already initialized" path is avoided.
- **Rule:** heavy SDK bring-up (`dwt_probe` / `dwt_initialise`, OTP reads) belongs in a
  dedicated startup task with a real stack, not a protocol-event callback.

### 2.3 Onboard WS2812 status LED is on GPIO48
**VERIFIED.** The ESP32-S3 dev board's addressable status LED is GPIO48 (single WS2812),
used for bolt-state indication. (commits `ad9a63b`, `ed38895`)

---

## 3. BLE / NimBLE coexistence with Matter

### 3.1 The reader must "attach" to Matter's NimBLE host, not spin up its own
**VERIFIED.** esp-matter already owns the NimBLE host for commissioning. A second BLE
stack instance crashes / reinit-loops. The Aliro reader runs in **attach mode**: it
coexists on Matter's host rather than initialising its own. (commits `67234fa`,
`996a8d5` — the latter fixed a reader-reinit crash loop by keeping BLE up.)

### 3.2 Keep BLE advertising up across reader restarts
Tearing BLE down/up around reader lifecycle caused crashes. The reader keeps the GAP
advertising alive and re-arms the session instead of cycling the stack. (commit
`996a8d5`)

### 3.3 The Aliro transaction must stay on the nimble_host task
**VERIFIED.** Driving the Aliro APDU exchange from another task races the host. The whole
credential-auth + ranging lifecycle (create / feed / teardown + the engine's transmit &
event callbacks) runs **synchronously on the BLE-host task**, so no locking is needed
there. Provisioning state shared with the REPL task (`s_trust`, `s_last_cred`) is the
one thing guarded by a FreeRTOS mutex. (commit `04bd8cc`)

### 3.4 Advertising service data
The reader advertises the Aliro 0xFFF2 service with a dynamic tag for phone
approach-connect. Note the separate `DYNAMIC_TAG` staleness trap: approach-unlock dies
when the clock is valid but far behind real time (advertisement expiry tag), first hit
on the nRF side. The analogue is handled here: the tag expiry is live (SNTP-fed wall
clock, `now + 900 s`), re-derived at half the window and immediately on a time step,
with the spec's "expiry unavailable" form as the no-clock fallback. (commit
`5a4e6c4`)

## 4. Aliro credential-auth crypto & key schedule

**Every fact in this section is published in the Aliro 1.0 specification** (CSA document
26-42802-001, February 18, 2026), which the Connectivity Standards Alliance distributes
free and without registration at
<https://csa-iot.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/26-42802-001_Aliro_1.0_specification.pdf>.
Each subsection cites its spec section plus the line number in a `pdftotext` extraction
of that PDF (12100 lines, SHA-256 `3ede12c5b01d7fdf01c24b1ea5f2cd2da25a127c4f12f8f61ff9b208714a7d6a`),
so every citation here is independently checkable by anyone. One extraction gotcha: the
pseudocode assignment arrow quoted below as `←` is `U+F0DF` (a Symbol-font Private Use
Area codepoint) in the extracted text, so grep the surrounding words, not the arrow.

Values the specification does not fix, such as the concrete `0xA5`
proprietary-information TLV in section 4.3, were observed from a real iPhone on the wire.
Every fact below is additionally pinned by a host KAT.

**For downstream users:** `LicenseRef-Nordic-5-Clause` clause 4 restricts use to Nordic
integrated circuits, and `LicenseRef-QORVO-2` clause 3 restricts the DW3000 driver to
Qorvo ICs. Those field-of-use terms apply to any product built on this tree.

### 4.1 GCM per-direction counters start at **1**, not 0
**Spec: §8.3.1.12 and §8.3.1.13** — both session-bound counters,
`expedited_device_counter` and `expedited_reader_counter`, are required to be initialized
to `0x00000001`.

**VERIFIED (byte-exact KAT + silicon).** Both per-direction secure-channel counters start
at 1 (HomeKey starts at 0; do not copy HomeKey here). The first inbound decrypt
(AUTH1Response) uses device_counter = 1. Starting at 0 fails the GCM tag cleanly.
`aliro_secchan_init` sets both counters to 1.

### 4.2 GCM nonce layout
**Spec: §8.3.1.6 / §8.3.1.7 for the device direction,
§8.3.1.8 / §8.3.1.9 for the reader direction** — `IV ←
0x0000000000000001 || device_counter (unsigned big endian, 4 bytes)` and `IV ←
0x0000000000000000 || reader_counter (unsigned big endian, 4 bytes)` respectively.

So `nonce = 8-byte big-endian direction (0 = reader-seal, 1 = device-open) || 4-byte
big-endian per-direction counter`. Separate, non-wrapping counters per direction.

### 4.3 The salt sub-fields (§8.3.1.13)
**Spec: §8.3.1.13** gives the interface byte and the full
`salt_volatile` composition. The two sibling salts are stated the same way:
`salt_fast` in §8.3.1.12 and `salt_persistent` in §8.3.1.13.
These were never actually unresolved in the spec, only unresolved in this
project's reading of it, which is what cost the debugging time.

**VERIFIED.** The AUTH1 tag only decrypts once the session salt is exact:
- salt field 1 = **`reader_group_identifier_key.x` = pub(signingKey).x** — this is the
  reader's *signing* public key X, **not** the device ephemeral key (that was the bug).
  Derived via `aliro_ec_p256_pub_from_priv`; refreshed on identity load and on both
  Matter provisioning paths.
- salt item 4 = **interface byte**: `0xC3` when the transaction runs over the BLE
  transport, `0x5E` when it runs over NFC.
- salt item 10 = the phone's **`0xA5` SELECT-response proprietary-info TLV**. The spec
  requires it per Table 10-2; the concrete value
  `a5 08 80 02 0000 5c 02 0100` was observed from the phone's op-0x05 message on the
  wire.

### 4.4 Key-block layout (one HKDF expand → 160 bytes)
**Spec: §8.3.1.13** requires 160 bytes of derived key material
(`derived_keys_volatile`) produced by the §8.3.1.5 expand; the field offsets within that
block are enumerated there. `Kdh` comes from §8.3.1.4 (BSI TR-03111 §4.3 ECKA-DH over NIST P-256) and the expand from §8.3.1.5 (RFC 5869 HKDF-SHA-256).

`Z = SHA-256(ecdh_shared(32) || 0x00000001 || txid(16))`; then
`block160 = HKDF-SHA256(salt=CreateSalt transcript, IKM=Z, info=devicePubX(32), L=160)`.
Offsets in the block: `ExpeditedSKReader@0`, `ExpeditedSKDevice@32`, `StepUpSK@64`,
**`BleSK@96`**, **`URSK@128`**. Because it is one expand, **if auth works (ExpeditedSK@0
is right) the URSK@128 is byte-identical on both sides**, a fact that ruled out a lot of
false leads during ranging debug.

### 4.5 HKDF salt-vs-info binding (settled by §8.3.1.5)
**Spec: §8.3.1.5** states RFC 5869
explicitly: `Z : input_key_material`, `salt : salt`, `FixedInfo : info`,
`L : key_material_length`.

This was the last binding to fall into place during bring-up, and it cost time that
re-reading the specification would have saved. When a wire trace looks ambiguous, go back
to the spec text before reaching for anything else.

### 4.6 APDU / wire codec specifics
**Spec, per fact:**

| Fact | Aliro 1.0 |
| --- | --- |
| `AUTH0` INS = `0x80` | Table 8-3 |
| `AUTH1` INS = `0x81` | Table 8-9 |
| `EXCHANGE` INS = `0xC9` | Table 8-14, §8.3.3.5.1 |
| usage separators `0x415D9569` / `0x4E887B4C` | §8.3.3.4.3 |
| 4-byte Aliro message header, big-endian | §11.7, Table 11-10 |
| tag `0x97` absent on BLE success | §8.3.3.5.1 |

ISO7816 case-4 short form wraps AUTH0/AUTH1/EXCHANGE. The ECDSA transcript uses usage
separators `kReaderUsage=415d9569` / `kUserDeviceUsage=4e887b4c`. The L2CAP envelope is
the 4-byte header `[type & 0x3F][opcode][len_be16]`; Table 11-10 names those fields
Protocol Header (bits B5:B0 = protocol type) and Message ID, and §11.7 states that all
multi-octet integer fields are big-endian. EXCHANGE payload for the ranging flow is bare
`98 00` (URSK-ready, empty TLV): **VERIFIED**, and the spec agrees in §8.3.3.5.1, which
admits tag `0x97` in a Reader-sent BLE EXCHANGE only in the transaction-failure case.

### 4.7 The credential-auth §14 KAT is member-confidential
A host KAT reproduces the Aliro 1.0 §14 worked example byte-exact (salt, Kdh,
ExpeditedSKReader, BleSK, URSK, the split). It lives in **scratchpad only and is never
committed** — the §14 vectors are CSA member-Confidential. Same for the BleSK message KAT.

---

## 5. Ranging transport (post-auth M1–M4) — the deep ones

The reference reader relied on the **closed `libaliro` stack** to seal/open ranging SDUs
*below* the open glue. Phase 3 replaced that stack, so every one of these had to be
reimplemented from scratch — and each was a separate live-iPhone failure.

### 5.1 Ranging SDUs ride a SEPARATE GCM channel from the AP channel
**VERIFIED (spec §11.8 + silicon).** Proto-1/2/3 ranging SDUs do **not** use the
credential-auth (AP) secure channel. They use their own AES-256-GCM channel:
- Keys `BleSKReader` / `BleSKDevice` = `HKDF-SHA256(ikm = BleSK@96, info =
  "BleSKReader"/"BleSKDevice", salt = reader_supported_versions ||
  user_device_selected_version)` = `01000100` for v1.0-only.
- **Fresh** per-direction counters starting at **1** (not continued from auth).
- Feeding a proto-0 EXCHANGE response raw to the ranging engine yields `protocol 0
  unsupported` (byte 0 = the 0x00 envelope type) — a classic symptom of missing the
  channel split.

### 5.2 Ranging SDU framing — AAD carries the PLAINTEXT length
**VERIFIED (host KAT 15/15).** Wire form:
`[proto][id][(len_plain + 16)_be16][ciphertext || 16-byte tag]`, and the GCM **AAD is the
4-byte header with the *plaintext* length** `[proto][id][len_plain_be16]`, **not** the
wire length. Getting the AAD length field wrong is the single highest-risk mistake here;
it fails the tag with no other signal. Implemented in `aliro_msg_seal` / `aliro_msg_open`.

### 5.3 The missing step: Reader-Status-Access-Protocol-Completed
**VERIFIED against the reference binary.** After EXCHANGE success the reader **must** send
Reader-Status-AP-Completed (proto-2 id-3, BleSK-sealed) or the device stalls ~1.8 s and
disconnects (reason 531). Payload = `02 03 00 04 00 02 20 00` (TLV: attr-id 0, len 2,
value `[cap = 0x20][ReaderState = 0x00 Secured]`). Reader status values are Table 8-18;
these exact bytes are confirmed byte-for-byte against a live iPhone.

### 5.4 `00 02 00 00` is EXCHANGE SUCCESS, not a ranging cue
The `00 02 00 00` body that comes back on the EXCHANGE response is §8.3.3.5.5 success
(len `0x0002`, error `0x0000`). It is not a signal to start ranging; don't hand it to the
engine.

### 5.5 THE session-id trap: it is derived from the AUTH0 TXID, not chosen
**Spec: §11.7.2.1.3** — the Attribute Value field carries the
session identifier, taken as the low-order four octets of the Transaction Identifier
field (Table 8-4).

The ranging session-id is **not** the reader's free choice.
The device computes it from the 16-byte AUTH0 transaction id it received:

```
GenerateCryptoMaterials()  →  fills AccessProtocolCrypto[0..16] with a random TXID
GetSessionId()             =  rev(this[0xc])  =  big-endian(txid[12..15])
```

The device indexes its URSK by that session-id. Advertise a hardcoded session-id in M1
and the device replies with **GeneralError URSK_Unavailable (code 3)** at M1 and
disconnects — it has no URSK for the session you named, even though the URSK *value*
matches. Fix: M1's session-id must be `(txid[12]<<24)|(txid[13]<<16)|(txid[14]<<8)|
txid[15]`. This was the final blocker after auth + transport were correct.

### 5.6 M1 carries no URSK crypto — so `URSK_Unavailable` ≠ wrong URSK value
M1 (proto-1 id-0) contains only config attributes (config-id, pulse-shape, channel,
session-id). It carries no URSK-derived material, so a `URSK_Unavailable` at M1 means the
device has **no URSK installed for that session** (see 5.5), never a URSK value mismatch —
a value mismatch would surface later at M2/M3/M4 STS. This distinction saved a lot of
misdirected debugging.

### 5.7 Device-initiated M1
The engine emits M1 when the phone sends its Initiate-Ranging-Session (proto-2 id-1,
attr INIT_RANGING = 0x00), matching the observed iPhone. Do **not** eagerly send M1 on
StartRangingSession. (`aliro_uwb_msg.c:1164`)

### 5.8 Counter chain across the ranging handshake
Reader-direction (enc): AP-Completed = 1, M1 = 2, M3 = 3.
Device-direction (dec): the phone's first BleSK message (a proto-3 config) = 1,
Initiate-Ranging = 2, its event/M2 = 3 … Each side increments per message it *sends* on
the BleSK channel, including the proto-3 config the phone leads with.

### 5.9 proto-3 SupplementaryService is ignorable
The phone leads ranging with a proto-3 SupplementaryService config blob. **VERIFIED** the
reference's ranging engine (same Qorvo code) also returns "protocol 3 unsupported" for
it — both reference and port ignore it. It is not a step we skip; don't chase it.

### 5.10 THE Wallet animation gate: send Reader-Status-Changed on grant (step 23)
**VERIFIED byte-exact against a live iPhone**; operation-source values are Table 11-20.
Driving the bolt is not enough: iOS
plays the Wallet unlock animation only when the reader tells the phone it granted access
over the BleSK channel — the "Reader Status Changed" message, Aliro transaction
step 23 (the grant-phase sibling of 5.3's AP-Completed). Without it the port unlocked the
bolt locally, Matter saw the state change and posted a Matter *accessory* notification, but
the Wallet never animated. The phone's own computed distance is **not** the gate.

Payload (proto-2 id-2, BleSK-sealed) = `02 02 00 04 00 02 04 01` — one State Attribute
(attr-id 0, len 2) = `[OperationSource = 0x04 (this device, BLE+UWB Aliro flow),
ReaderState = 0x01 Unsecured]`; relock is identical with ReaderState = 0x00 Secured.
The 65-byte access-credential public key is **not** serialized: it selects which
connection to notify and is then dropped.

Send Unsecured on grant, Secured on relock, from the proximity relock task; post it onto
the BLE-host task so it serializes with the other BleSK seals (counter stays monotonic).
(commit `ba612c8`)

## 6. UWB DS-TWR ranging engine — the real-time layer

Once M1–M4 negotiate the session, the actual double-sided two-way ranging runs on the
DW3000: the phone drives Pre-POLL → POLL → (our) Response → Final → Final_Data every
~192 ms block, and the responder must arm each frame inside a ~2 ms slot. **This layer
is shared with the nRF5340 port (`modules/woz_uwb`), where it already worked — so nothing
here is a logic bug. Every trap below is the ESP32 being a slower, jitterier real-time
target than the nRF, and the fixes claw back the microseconds nRF gets for free.** All
**VERIFIED on silicon**: continuous positive DIST every round and the phone unlocks the
door.

### 6.1 The arm-latency-vs-2ms-slot budget is the whole game
Reactive arming fights a fixed deadline: `CCC_RX_SLOT_HI32 − CCC_RX_POLL_LEAD` (= 459000
hi32 units = **1836 µs**; the hi32/`dsys` unit is 4 ns, so `/250 = µs`). If the
Pre-POLL→arm path exceeds it, the delayed RX never opens and the POLL is lost
(`ARM FAIL … LATE`). On nRF this is trivial; on ESP every µs of SPI and dispatch counts,
which is why 6.2–6.7 exist.

### 6.2 DW3000 SPI: disable DMA (the biggest single win)
**VERIFIED.** A boot micro-benchmark (32 back-to-back DEV_ID reads) measured
**~84 µs/transaction** with `SPI_DMA_CH_AUTO`; holding the bus lock only saved ~15 µs, so
the rest is the per-transaction DMA-descriptor + `esp_cache_msync` path. For the small
STS/register writes on the arm critical path that setup dwarfs the bit-time. Fix: init the
bus **`SPI_DMA_DISABLED`** so ≤64-byte transfers use the CPU data registers directly, and
chunk anything larger into ≤64-byte bursts under one CS-low window (the DW3000 streams
sequentially). Only the DW3000 is on SPI2 (the status LED is on RMT), so this is safe.
This is what carried the chain to a sustained lock. (commit `d9051c8`)
- Clock is **not** the lever: 2 MHz vs 8 MHz was ~75 vs 84 µs — the ~6 µs of bit-time is
  lost in ~70 µs of fixed overhead.

### 6.3 An SP3-ND Final completes with RXFR|CIADONE, not RXFCG
**VERIFIED.** The POLL is an SP3 STS frame carrying FCS (completes `st=0x6700`, has
RXFCG=0x4000). The **Final is SP3-ND (STS only, no PHR/payload)** — it completes
`st=0xa7b0` with RXFR|CIADONE and **no RXFCG**. Any Final-detect that waits on RXFCG hangs
forever; watch CIADONE(0x400). A synchronous busy-wait for the Final *inside* the POLL
callback also fails: the SP3-ND completion lands after the handler returns, and the spin
wedged the receiver / tripped the watchdog. Capture the Final in its own async callback.

### 6.4 "Negative distance" was cross-round mixing, NOT antenna delay
**VERIFIED — a multi-run red herring.** t2/t3/t6 (POLL-RX / Response-TX / Final-RX) are
single globals. On ESP the phone's SP0 Final_Data lands only after the *next* round has
overwritten t2/t3, so recomputing the DS-TWR intervals in `final_data_decode` mixed this
round's t6 with the next round's t3 → km-scale garbage, or a **plausible-looking but wrong
negative distance that still passed the STS gate**. The `-783 mm` / `-333 mm` readings
looked exactly like an uncalibrated antenna delay and sent us chasing calibration. Fix:
snapshot `reply1 = t3−t2`, `round2 = t6−t3` at Final capture (same round), consume once
(`g_final_round_valid`). With correct pairing the distances are **positive and realistic
with no antenna calibration at all** (~0 mm at contact, ~21 cm for a phone at ~21 cm).
ESP-guarded so the nRF path keeps its original recompute-from-live-globals (nRF processes
Final_Data before the overwrite). (commit `d9051c8`) **Lesson: a constant-looking offset
that passes your integrity gate can be a data-pairing bug, not a physical calibration.**

### 6.5 THE Final_Data trap: blocking `printk` in the hot path starves the ISR task
**VERIFIED — the last blocker before the door opened.** `DIAGK` → `printk`, which is
**blocking** on ESP. `POLL result` + `FINAL result` printed **every round** (~185 chars);
at 115200 that cannot drain inside the ~6 ms burst of per-round callbacks, so the DW3000
ISR task (which runs `dwt_isr` + the callbacks) backs up. One cause, two symptoms:
- The **Final callback dispatches late** → the SP0 revert re-opens RX *after* the phone's
  Final_Data slot (~1 slot ≈ 2 ms behind the Final) → Final_Data never caught → **no
  distance ever computed**, even though POLL/Response/Final were flawless.
- The sustained backlog **trips the task watchdog** → spontaneous reset mid-session.

Fix: throttle `POLL result` and `FINAL result` to the first `CCC_RX_PREPOLL_LOG` (16)
rounds so the steady state is print-free (PREPOLL and RESP-txdone were already gated).
Moving a print *within* a callback cannot help — the callback itself was firing late.
**A per-round blocking log in a 2-ms-deadline path is a real-time bug, not just noise.**
(commit `677cfd1`)

### 6.6 Time-critical FIRST: revert to SP0 before the (throttled) print
The Final handler reverts SP3→SP0 (`revert_to_sp0_listen`) to catch the Final_Data; do it
**before** the diagnostic print, mirroring the POLL handler which arms the Response before
its stsq read + printk. (Redundant once 6.5 throttles the print, but the correct ordering
and cheap insurance.) (commit `677cfd1`)

### 6.7 STS key cache — the dURSK is per ranging CYCLE
**VERIFIED.** The STS key (dURSK) is constant across a whole ranging cycle (POLL,
Response, Final, and every block in the cycle share it), but each arm re-wrote all four
STS_KEY registers (~258 µs, ~40 % of the arm). Cache the loaded dURSK and skip
`dwt_configurestskey` when unchanged; the registers persist across the per-frame
IV/loadiv/mode reprogramming. Helps the Response/Final arms (same-cycle key = cache hit);
the POLL arm's key changes per block so it misses. ESP-guarded. (commit `d9051c8`)

### 6.8 Auto-relock: a fixed timer fights approach-unlock — drive relock from proximity
`create_auto_relock_time(door_lock_cluster, 5)` made the bolt relock 5 s after an unlock,
so a successful approach-unlock re-locked while the phone was still right there. A fixed
timer is fundamentally wrong for approach-unlock: you cannot both "relock after N s" and
"stay unlocked while the peer is present." Fix: set **`AutoRelockTime = 0`** — CHIP's
`DoorLockServer` skips scheduling when it is 0 (`VerifyOrReturnError(0 != autoRelockTime,
true)`) — and drive relock from proximity in `aliro_reader_task`: unlock at
`<= ALIRO_UNLOCK_RANGE_CM` (100 cm), hold while present, relock when the peer moves past
`ALIRO_RELOCK_RANGE_CM` (150 cm — hysteresis stops boundary flapping) or the ranging
session drops. Re-unlock within one session now works too (the old code debounced until
disconnect). Not a ranging fault; a lock-policy design choice.

### 6.9 ESP vs nRF: the logic is shared and proven; ESP is the real-time port
The whole Aliro/CCC/DS-TWR stack in `modules/woz_uwb` is compiled by **both** the nRF5340
Aliro app and this ESP port. When ESP misbehaved, the bug was never in that shared logic
(the nRF proves it) — it was ESP's slower SPI + jitterier callback dispatch. Two
consequences worth remembering: (a) lean on the nRF reference to confirm intent before
re-deriving on hardware; (b) any ESP-only tweak to the shared file must be
`#if defined(ESP_PLATFORM)`-guarded so the nRF build keeps the original path — the
snapshot (6.4) and STS-key cache (6.7) are both guarded, verified by the host suite
(`tests/host/run.sh`, 558/558) compiling the file *without* `ESP_PLATFORM`. (commit
`d9051c8`)

### 6.10 On the single-core C6, priority 23 no longer isolates the DW3000 worker
**PREDICTED: derived from ESP-IDF v5.5.4 source and docs. No C6 has been on a bench with
a DWM3000 yet, so this is a hazard to measure before it bites, not a failure that was
seen.** (The rest of section 6 is VERIFIED on silicon; this entry is the exception.)

On the S3 the DW3000 IRQ worker owns a core: `dw3000_hw.c` pins it to core 1 via
`WOZ_DW3000_TASK_CORE` at priority 23 while IDF's built-in radio tasks sit on core 0, so
its priority never has to win an argument. The C6 has one core, which makes
`WOZ_DW3000_TASK_CORE` 0 and leaves priority as the only isolation, and 23 does not clear
the traffic it has to beat:

| task | prio | source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DW3000 IRQ worker | 23 | `xTaskCreatePinnedToCore(…, 23, …)` in `dw3000_hw.c` |
| Wi-Fi | 23 | IDF `docs/en/api-guides/performance/speed.rst`, single-core list |
| BT/BLE controller | 23 | `ESP_TASK_BT_CONTROLLER_PRIO` = `ESP_TASK_PRIO_MAX - 2`, and `configMAX_PRIORITIES` is 25 |
| esp_timer | 22 | `ESP_TASK_TIMER_PRIO` |
| NimBLE host | 21 | speed.rst, as above |
| esp_event | 20 | `ESP_TASKD_EVENT_PRIO` |
| lwIP TCP/IP | 18 | `ESP_TASK_TCPIP_PRIO` |

The C6 controller really does take that constant:
`components/bt/include/esp32c6/include/esp_bt.h` sets
`.controller_task_prio = ESP_TASK_BT_CONTROLLER_PRIO` in its default config. So the UWB
worker ties with the BLE controller, and with Wi-Fi if it is up.

Two FreeRTOS details turn the tie into latency rather than resolving it:
- **An equal-priority wake does not preempt.** The GPIO ISR's `xSemaphoreGiveFromISR`
  reaches `xTaskRemoveFromEventList`, whose single-core build (`configNUMBER_OF_CORES == 1`)
  requests a yield only when `pxUnblockedTCB->uxPriority > pxCurrentTCBs[0]->uxPriority`,
  strictly greater. At equal priority the worker is appended to the *back* of the
  priority-23 ready list and the controller keeps the CPU.
- **It then waits for a time slice.** `configUSE_TIME_SLICING` is 1, and both apps set
  `CONFIG_FREERTOS_HZ=1000`, so the ready list rotates on the next 1 ms tick (10 ms at
  IDF's default 100 Hz, which is why that setting is not optional here).

Against 6.1's 1836 µs arm deadline, one tick is over half the budget spent before any SPI
runs. Expected symptom: intermittent `ARM FAIL … LATE` and lost POLLs on C6 from firmware
that is clean on S3, correlating with BLE activity, which during an Aliro session is
continuous because the L2CAP channel is what carries M1–M4.

**Do not raise the worker to 24 without measuring first.** That puts UWB above the radio
controller, which Espressif explicitly advises against ("it is not recommended to set task
priorities higher than the built-in … operations as starving them of CPU may make the
system unstable"), and BLE is load-bearing here: a starved controller drops the very
session the ranging belongs to. Measure instead. The latch is already in the hot path:
`dw3000_hw.c` writes `g_dw_cyc_gpio` at GPIO-ISR entry and `g_dw_cyc_work` at worker entry,
so their difference *is* this latency. But the only code that reads them sits behind
`#if DIAG_HOT` in `deps/dw3000/dwt_uwb_driver/dw3000/dw3000_device.c`, which is `#define
DIAG_HOT 0`. Flip that, take the distribution on C6 and on S3, and let the two histograms
decide. Note `g_dw_cyc_per_us` initialises from `CONFIG_ESP_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ`, which is
160 on C6 and 240 on the Matter S3 build, so the cycle counts convert correctly on both.

## 7. Reader state-machine & diagnostics

### 7.1 The GeneralError short-circuit must not fire during ranging
**VERIFIED.** The reader had a blanket rule: a proto-2 / id-0 Notification-Event mid-auth
is a device GeneralError, so read `payload[2]` as the code. During `PH_ESTABLISHED` those
events are **BleSK-encrypted**, so `payload[2]` is a ciphertext byte — the reader was
reporting `GeneralError 0x28` one run and `0xf6` the next (random ciphertext) and killing
the session before decrypting the real event. Guard the short-circuit to
pre-ranging phases; in `PH_ESTABLISHED` always BleSK-open + dump + feed the engine. This
is what finally surfaced the real `general error 3`. (`aliro_reader.c` ~line 583)

### 7.2 Read the *decrypted* error, and log it
General-error codes: `0 UNKNOWN, 1 RESOURCE_UNAVAILABLE, 2 WRONG_PARAMS, 3
URSK_UNAVAILABLE`. `WRONG_PARAMS (2)` points at M1 attribute values; `URSK_UNAVAILABLE
(3)` points at the session-id / URSK-install path (§5). The codes are only meaningful
once the SDU is opened.

## 8. Provisioning & identity

### 8.1 A per-boot random reader key changes the reader's identity every reboot
**VERIFIED.** The reader originally generated a random dev P-256 key at boot, so its
reader-id (and therefore the salt's reader_group_key) changed each power cycle — the
phone's stored credential no longer matched. Fixed by a **fixed, non-secret dev
identity** loaded from NVS (`aliro_prov` namespace, key `blob`): reader-id = signing
pub.X. (commit `ca937e2`)

### 8.2 DEV identity is dev-open + loud, not a bypass
With a DEV identity and no trust anchors, the reader accepts the presented credential
**and logs a warning**; it is an interim seam for real issuer-chain validation, not a
silent allow. Bench commands: `aliro-prov` (show id / trust / last cred), `aliro-trust`
(persist the last-presented credential key). Phase-4 Matter `SetAliroReaderConfig` writes
the same blob.

### 8.3 Zephyr-reserved NVS id wiped external NVS (cross-port cousin)
On the nRF side, a rollback unique-id mirror at Zephyr-reserved NVS id `0xFFFF` wiped
external NVS every boot (fixed `0xFFFF → 0xFFFE`). If ESP32 external-NVS credentials ever
vanish across reboot, suspect an id collision with a reserved slot.

## 9. Debugging an opaque peripheral: the probe that ended three wrong theories

**VERIFIED (2026-07-25).** The channel-impulse CIR tap dump returned a fixed
non-physical blob for most receptions: byte-identical at every accumulator offset,
saturated at the `int16` limits. Six bench runs and three failed hypotheses before the
real cause, which is that **the DW3000 accumulator cannot be read while the receiver is
up.** The capture ran after chaining to the blob's RX handler, and on the Final that
handler immediately re-arms an SP0 listen, so the receiver was overwriting the
accumulator underneath the read.

Kept here because the wrong turns are the reusable part:

| Theory | Killed by |
|---|---|
| The 97-byte read splits across the ESP32's 64 B non-DMA SPI limit | Splitting into 8-tap sub-reads made it **worse** (0/16 windows real, against 3/16 and 4/16 before). Reverted |
| `dwt_readcir`'s ACC clock forcing was not sticking | `CLK_CTRL` read back identical (`11796992`) in both the working and the broken case |
| The RSSI power gate was closing and dropping the link | No gate-close line anywhere in the log; the gate only ever held AP-Completed |

What actually cracked it was a throwaway shell command, `lab cir probe`
(`uwb_cirdiag_probe`): read the same window at three different accumulator offsets, then
repeat the first offset, then repeat it once more in `DWT_CIR_READ_FULL` so the raw
24-bit words are visible before the reduced modes saturate them. It reads as:

- passes at different offsets identical → the sample offset is being ignored
- first and repeated pass differ at the same offset → the read is racing something
- `clk` without the ACC enable bits → the clock forcing did not stick

It showed idle reads are perfect (offsets differ, the repeat is byte-identical, values
sit at a physical noise floor) and only live-session reads are corrupt. That pointed
straight at the receiver. Worth keeping for the next opaque-peripheral bug: **an A/B that
varies one address and repeats one measurement beats any amount of reasoning about the
bus.**

Two lessons that generalise past this chip:

- **A fix that makes the symptom worse is a result, not a setback.** The sub-read split
  going from 4/16 to 0/16 was what ruled out the entire SPI layer.
- **Instrument the boundary you cannot see.** Every hypothesis here was about the
  transport; none of them survived contact with a probe that could distinguish
  "addressing wrong" from "data wrong" from "timing wrong."

## 10. Current status — approach-unlock works end to end

- **VERIFIED on a live iPhone (2026-07-20):** the full Aliro approach-unlock — the Wallet
  unlock animation plays as you walk up, then relocks on departure. The final gate was the
  reader→phone Reader-Status-Changed grant message (5.10); before it the bolt moved and
  Matter reported it, but the Wallet stayed silent.
- **VERIFIED on silicon (full path):** credential-auth (discovery / L2CAP CoC / AUTH0 /
  AUTH1 decrypt / device-signature / credential-trust / URSK) → M1–M4 ranging setup →
  **live DS-TWR**: continuous positive DIST every round, tracking the phone (d ~6–45 cm at
  arm's length, growing as it withdraws), then `Aliro trusted range NN cm (<= 100):
  unlocking` and auto-relock. No watchdog resets. Against a live iPhone.
- **No antenna calibration was needed** — see 6.4; the earlier "negative distance" was a
  cross-round pairing bug, not a physical offset.
- **Open polish (non-blocking):** per-round DIST jitter (the AccessManager already
  medians/filters it enough to unlock cleanly); auto-relock time (6.8); the phone's
  `general error 0` at end-of-session is post-unlock and benign.
