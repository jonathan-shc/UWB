# Hardware validation

Automated CI gates the host-side logic (KAT suite, coverage floor, sanitizers, fuzz,
CBMC, the ESP32 port suite), and a dispatch of
[`firmware-builds.yml`](../.github/workflows/firmware-builds.yml) compile-gates all
three targets' firmware. What it cannot
exercise is the product itself, which runs against a live iPhone. This checklist is
the manual gate: run
every applicable item before cutting a release, and record the results table in the
release notes (see [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md)).

Three hardware paths have recorded bench evidence: the DWM3001CDK, the nRF5340 DK
using the legacy Nordic binary with its default ST25R300/RFAL reader, and ESP32-S3.
The in-tree Aliro stack is now the nRF default, but it does not inherit the legacy
binary's result. It must pass the nRF checklist before release. A release covering
only one target runs that target's rows and records the others as `n/a`.

ESP32-C5 is built and bundled by the release workflow, but has no hardware
validation record. Mark it build-only in release notes until a C5 checklist is
defined and passed. The PN532 variant likewise has automated evidence only and
does not inherit the ST25R300 checklist result.

## DWM3001CDK

The primary target, and the shortest bench setup there is: one nRF52833 and the
DW3110 in the same module, nothing to wire, on-board J-Link OB. No NFC tap path
exists here and none can, so there is no equivalent of HV-5. The board carries no
reader IC, and the nRF52833's own NFC peripheral is tag-emulation only.

### Test setup

- A DWM3001CDK on USB, over its on-board J-Link OB. No EVB to seat, no ribbon.
- `make dfu-key`, once per clone. Every image on this board is signed and the key
  is gitignored, so a fresh clone or a new git worktree stops at configure until
  it has one of its own.
- A Thread border router the phone already reaches, for the Matter image
  (`make build`). A `make reader` image needs neither that nor a commissioner.
- An iPhone with the lock's Aliro key in Wallet. Apple Home mints it during
  CDK-7; a `reader` image takes an imported credential instead, per
  [`apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/README.md`](../apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/README.md).
- Console attached with `make monitor`. It is RTT, not UART, so `make nrf-term`
  does not reach this board.

### Checklist

The Recorded column is what this repository has already seen on hardware. It is
not a substitute for running the row: a release records the result you got, not
this one.

| ID | Procedure | Pass criterion | Recorded |
|---|---|---|---|
| CDK-1 | `make test` on the release commit | Exit 0, all host KATs pass | CI gate |
| CDK-2 | `make dfu-key`, then `make rebuild` (pristine) | Exit 0; the image links and fits the 433,664 B `app` partition | yes: 409,988 B (94.54%), 125,012 B RAM (95.38%), 6,060 B of RAM spare |
| CDK-3 | `make reader PRISTINE=1` | Exit 0; the reader-only image links and fits | yes: 285,664 B (65.87%), 79,908 B RAM (60.96%) |
| CDK-4 | Flash a `make selftest` build, boot with no phone present | `DW3000 raw DEV_ID = 0xdeca0302` on the RTT console | yes |
| CDK-5 | `make flash-erase` with the release image, then boot | Clean boot, `ECDH self-test: PASS`, BLE advertising starts, no faults | yes |
| CDK-6 | Connect from an iPhone with a BLE scanner | 0xFFF2 enumerates with both characteristics and never prompts to pair; the reader-SPSM characteristic reads `00 80 02 01 00 01 01` | yes |
| CDK-7 | Add the accessory in Apple Home with the setup code the build printed | Commissioning completes and the lock tile goes live | yes |
| CDK-8 | Relock, then approach from well outside ranging distance, phone pocketed | Wallet animation plays and the bolt opens, with no phone interaction | yes: four unlocks in one session, 2026-08-02 |
| CDK-9 | Walk away | Bolt relocks past the hysteresis margin and does not oscillate at the boundary | no recorded result; run it |
| CDK-10 | Power-cycle the board, wait for boot, repeat CDK-8 | Unlock works without re-commissioning or re-provisioning | no recorded result; run it |
| CDK-11 | Change something in the tree, then `make dfu`, pressing SW2 when it asks | The delta goes over Bluetooth and the board's flash comes out byte for byte identical to the target image, with a matching CRC | yes, 2026-08-03 (`bca7534`, `ed1780c`); the apply takes 17 to 31 s |
| CDK-12 | Repeat CDK-11, opening the window from Apple Home's "Turn On Pairing Mode" instead of pressing SW2 | D10, the blue LED, blinks at 2 Hz while the window is open, and the push is accepted | yes, on a live commissioned lock, for both openers |
| CDK-13 | `make fota`, push the file from a phone with nRF Device Manager's **Images** tab, then `make fota-done` | The board comes back reporting the target image's SHA-256 | yes, on the commissioned lock (`53b2fe1`, `8447e91`) |
| CDK-14 | 100 walk-ups, counting the ones that unlock | 95% or better | **open, never run**; the sample so far is single digits |
| CDK-15 | Cut the power in the middle of a CDK-11 apply, then restore it | The board resumes at the right step and boots the target image | **open, never run** |

CDK-8 is this target's EV-7, and it is faked the same way: the bolt moving is not a
pass. The Wallet animation is, because that is what proves the reader told the phone
it granted access rather than just actuating locally.

CDK-14 and CDK-15 are the two open rows, and neither has ever been run. CDK-14 is
the only rate on this list: everything above it has been demonstrated at least once,
and none of it at a rate. CDK-15 is the resumable apply, whose step counter is
exercised by design and by host test but has never met a real power cut.

## nRF5340 DK

### Test setup

- nRF5340 DK with DWM3000EVB (Arduino header) and X-NUCLEO-NFC12A1, wired per
  [`apps/nrf5340dk-lock/overlays/dw3000-nfc.overlay`](../apps/nrf5340dk-lock/overlays/dw3000-nfc.overlay).
- `make dfu-key`, once per clone, the same key the DWM3001CDK uses. `DFU=1` is
  this board's default and the build refuses to give MCUboot a key it does not
  own. `DFU=0` builds the older no-bootloader layout and needs none.
- An iPhone (or Apple Watch) with the lock's Aliro key provisioned in Wallet.
- Serial console attached (`make nrf-term`) to observe logs.

### Checklist

| ID | Procedure | Pass criterion |
|---|---|---|
| HV-1 | `make test` on the release commit | Exit 0, all host KATs pass |
| HV-2 | `make rebuild` (pristine) | Exit 0, image links and fits flash |
| HV-3 | Flash a `make selftest` build, boot with no phone present | Boot self-test reports pass on the console |
| HV-4 | Flash the release image (`make flash-erase` for a first flash), boot | Clean boot, `Aliro source stack enabled` appears with no errors, BLE advertising starts |
| HV-5 | Tap the phone on the NFC reader (Express Mode, screen off) | Lock actuates to unlocked; console logs the granted access |
| HV-6 | Relock, then approach from well outside ranging distance, phone pocketed | Lock unlocks on approach with no phone interaction |
| HV-7 | Walk away from the lock | Lock relocks after passing the hysteresis margin, and does not oscillate at the boundary |
| HV-8 | Power-cycle the DK, wait for boot, repeat HV-5 and HV-6 | Both unlock paths work without re-provisioning the key |

## ESP32-S3

No NFC tap path exists on this target, so there is no equivalent of HV-5.

### Test setup

- ESP32-S3 dev board with a DWM3000EVB wired per
  [`docs/esp32-bringup.md`](esp32-bringup.md), including the EVB's
  power-select jumper.
- An iPhone with a key provisioned in Wallet for *this* reader identity. A key minted
  against a different reader will not authenticate.
- Serial console attached (`make monitor` from `apps/esp32-matter-lock`).

### Checklist

| ID | Procedure | Pass criterion |
|---|---|---|
| EV-1 | `make test-port` on the release commit | Exit 0, all host suites pass |
| EV-2 | `make rebuild` in `apps/esp32-matter-lock` | Exit 0; `verify_port.sh` reports the link seam intact and the app fits its partition |
| EV-3 | `make flash-erase`, then boot | Clean boot, onboarding codes printed, no watchdog resets |
| EV-4 | Commission into a home with the printed code | Commissioning completes; `status` shows the fabric |
| EV-5 | Confirm a key lands in the phone's wallet | Key appears, tied to this reader |
| EV-6 | `ultrawidelock prov` on the console | Reports a provisioned identity, not the dev-identity fallback warning |
| EV-7 | Approach from well outside ranging distance, phone pocketed | Wallet unlock animation plays and the bolt opens, with no phone interaction |
| EV-8 | Watch the console through EV-7 | Continuous positive distances tracking the approach; no watchdog reset |
| EV-9 | Walk away | Bolt relocks past the hysteresis margin and does not oscillate at the boundary |
| EV-10 | Re-approach within the same session | Unlocks again without a reconnect |
| EV-11 | Power-cycle the board, wait for boot, repeat EV-7 | Unlock works without re-commissioning or re-provisioning |
| EV-12 | `lab on`, then approach from beyond BLE range and watch the trace | `gate.hold` appears and no `rrx`/`rtx` follows until `gate.open`; the radio stays dark while the phone is far |
| EV-13 | Loiter out of range for ~10 s during EV-12 | Repeated `session.start` / `gate.hold` / `session.end` cycles are correct, not a fault; the phone gives up at ~1.9 s and retries |
| EV-14 | Unlock, then stand still at the door for 10 s | No `relock.sent`, bolt does not cycle. iOS pauses ranging when still; a relock here is the regression |
| EV-15 | Unlock, then leave briskly | `relock.sent` appears **before** `session.end`, and the phone shows locked as you go |
| EV-16 | Re-approach after EV-15 | No `relock.sent` between `ph.apc` and the grant, i.e. the Wallet does not flash locked then unlocked |
| EV-17 | Score any capture that reached UWB-active with `tools/aliro_lab.py` | The `order` check passes. `ph.m1` before `ph.m2` and `ph.m3` before `ph.m4rx`: setup stamps follow message identity, not arrival order |
| EV-18 | Read the `ranging setup:` line of that report | Reads `rrx SUPPL id=0, rrx IRS, rtx M1, rrx M2, rtx M3, rrx M4`. A bare `rrx id=` with no protocol means pre-fix firmware |

EV-7 is the row that matters most and the one most easily faked: the bolt moving is not
a pass. The Wallet animation is the pass criterion, because that is what proves the
reader told the phone it granted access rather than just actuating locally.

EV-12 to EV-16 gate the RSSI power gate and the relock policy; see
[`power-profile.md`](power-profile.md) for what each measurement means and for the
thresholds they depend on. EV-14 and EV-16 are regression rows: both behaviours were
shipped broken once and are invisible unless specifically looked for.

EV-17 and EV-18 are the third such row. The ranging-setup latency stamps used to be
assigned by arrival order, and the phone sends a proto-3 (supplementary-service) SDU
ahead of Initiate-Ranging-Session, so every device-to-reader label sat one frame early
— the report claimed M2 arrived before M1 was sent. Nothing in the protocol depended
on it, but every setup timing read from those captures was wrong. Measured on the
fixed firmware, the setup exchange is IRS +2.0 ms M1, +27.8 ms M2, +2.4 ms M3,
+27.7 ms M4; the old labelling reported that as a 29.7 ms IRS-to-M4 span, which was
really IRS to M2.

## Recording results

Copy the relevant tables into the release notes with a Result column (`pass` / `fail` /
`n/a`), plus: firmware commit hash, toolchain version (NCS, or ESP-IDF and esp-matter),
board revision, phone model, and iOS version. A release ships only when every applicable
row is `pass`.
