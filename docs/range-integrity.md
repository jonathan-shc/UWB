# Range integrity: what a signed distance is worth

A presence assertion exists to be believed by someone who was not in the room.
Its whole content is a distance, so the interesting question is not "what did
the radio report" but "why should a third party believe that number was
measured rather than chosen".

This document records what defends the number today, what does not, and the one
measurement still missing.

## The layers

`modules/woz_uwb/src/fira/fira_session.h` defines four, numbered with a gap.

| Layer | Check | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Plausibility band: below `-30 cm` is physically impossible, above 30 m is outside any proximity envelope | Always enforced |
| 2 | STS quality: the scrambled timestamp sequence correlated well enough to trust the timestamp | Recorded always; enforced for presence, optional for the lock |
| 3 | Ipatov first-path check | **Removed** — untunable on this hardware |
| 4 | Cross-block consensus: K=3 consecutive blocks agreeing within 50 cm | Always enforced |

Layer 2 is the one that matters against a distance-reduction attack. A spoofed
early first path cannot reproduce the scrambled sequence, so its STS quality
collapses. Layers 1 and 4 are statistical filters; they raise the cost of an
attack without making it a cryptographic impossibility.

## What was wrong

`CONFIG_WOZ_RANGE_GATE_STRICT` gated layer 2 before it could reach the range
store. It defaulted to `n` ("shadow mode": log the verdict, latch the block
anyway), and the symbol was declared only in the Zephyr Kconfig tree. On ESP32
it was not merely off — it was **unreachable**, so `idf.py` could not produce
it and the `#if` in `ccc_shim_rx.c` could never be true.

That is the platform that signs presence assertions. Every frame the bench run
produced carried a distance that had passed plausibility and consensus but no
integrity check at all, and the frame had no field in which to say so.

## What changed

1. **The evidence travels with the range.** `fira_session_set_ccc_range_sts()`
   publishes the per-block verdict; the store accumulates it and
   `fira_session_last_range_integrity()` reports it. A latch with no evidence
   reads as a failed STS, never a passed one.
2. **The window matches layer 4.** The verdict is "the last K blocks all
   correlated", counted rather than AND-ed over the whole run, so one marginal
   block cannot poison a stationary phone indefinitely — it heals after K clean
   blocks.
3. **Presence fails closed; the lock does not.** The two consumers want
   opposite failure modes. A mis-tuned floor that refuses to open a door locks a
   human out of their house. A mis-tuned floor that refuses to sign an assertion
   costs one retry. Presence therefore requires a good STS regardless of the
   build flag; the door keeps shadow behaviour unless
   `CONFIG_WOZ_RANGE_GATE_STRICT` is set, which is now selectable on ESP32 too.
4. **The evidence is signed.** Wire version 3 carries `range_flags`,
   `sts_quality` and `trust_level` inside the signed prefix. A verifier checks
   the claim instead of assuming the producer ran the check, and a frame that
   does not claim a good STS is rejected (`E_INTEGRITY`). v2 frames are refused
   rather than reinterpreted.
5. **Policy can tighten without reflashing.** `presence_verify.py
   --min-sts-quality N` demands better correlation than the firmware was built
   with.

## Still outstanding

**`FIRA_STS_QUALITY_MIN` is 0**, which means "defer to the driver verdict". It
has never been sized from real captures, and the Kconfig help has said to do
that since before this change. The flight recorder already logs `stsq_val` and
`stsq_ret` (`flight_recorder.h`), so the capture path exists: record a walk-up,
histogram the quality index, pick a floor above the noise. Until that happens,
layer 2 rejects only what the DW3000 driver itself calls bad.

**Relay resistance is still not measured.** Nothing here tests it. The
time-of-flight argument is structural, and enforcing STS is what the structural
argument depends on, but no one has attacked this stack. Do not describe it as
tested. The relevant published work to read first is the literature on
distance-reduction attacks against HRP UWB with STS.

**A compromised producer can still assert anything.** The evidence is signed by
the same key that signs the distance, so it proves the frame came from an
enrolled device, not that the device was honest. This is the same limit the
identity-clone attack demonstrates.
