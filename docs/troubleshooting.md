# Troubleshooting

Common issues, grouped by target. Deeper protocol background is in
[`protocol-research.md`](protocol-research.md) (on-air behavior) and
[`protocol-notes.md`](protocol-notes.md) (firmware time and credential behavior).

| Section | Target |
|---|---|
| [DWM3001CDK](#dwm3001cdk) | the primary board, one nRF52833 with the DW3110 beside it |
| [Build and flash](#build-and-flash-nrf5340-dk), [Hardware](#hardware-nrf5340-dk-and-dwm3000evb) | nRF5340 DK, the target with NFC |
| [ESP32-S3 ports](#esp32-s3-ports) | ESP32, and then the much longer [gotchas log](esp32-gotchas.md) |
| [Unlock behavior](#unlock-behavior) | any target: this is protocol, not board |
| [Tests and CI gates](#tests-and-ci-gates) | the host sweep, no hardware involved |

Bare make targets mean the DWM3001CDK. The nRF5340 DK is `nrf-` prefixed and the
ESP32 is `esp-` prefixed; `make` with no target prints the grouped list.

## DWM3001CDK

Full detail is in [`../apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/README.md`](../apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/README.md), and the
bring-up traps that cost real time are in
[`dwm3001cdk-surgery.md`](dwm3001cdk-surgery.md). This is the triage list.

**`make build` fails at configure, complaining about a signing key.** Run
`make dfu-key` once. Every image on this board is signed and the key is
gitignored, so a fresh clone or a new git worktree has none. The build refuses
rather than falling back to the demo key published in MCUboot's own repository.
`make nrf-build` stops the same way and takes the same fix, because the nRF5340
DK signs with the same key under its default `DFU=1`.

**`make monitor` attaches cleanly and prints nothing.** Usually the ELF: probe-rs
reads the RTT control block address out of the ELF you pass it, so attaching with
one you built but did not flash reads a stale address, which looks exactly like a
dead board. Reflash, or point `CDK_RTT_BUILD` at the image the board is actually
running.

**A log line looks wrong, or mentions something the code cannot do.** Check it is
real. probe-rs prints tails of `.rodata` strings out of the ELF, so a phantom
line can appear with no target involved. A real line has an `HH:MM:SS.mmm:`
prefix, a complete sentence, and its `%d` and `%s` substituted; a phantom has
none of those. More than one investigation here has gone down that trail.

**The probe enumerates but nothing can connect to it.** A stale process still
holds the USB interface, usually after an interrupted `west flash` or a
SIGTERMed `probe-rs attach`. Replugging works but needs a human; killing the
holders does not:

```bash
pkill -f 'jlinkarm_nrf_worker_osx'
pkill -f 'JLinkGUIServerExe'
```

A `make flash` that reports "Timed out waiting for response from worker" after
"Verifying image" has usually programmed the board correctly and only failed on
the reset. Check with a read before reflashing.

**Apple Home sits on "Adding to Home" and never finishes.** If the board was
factory-erased, this used to be OpenThread's SRP client: name ownership is
first-come by key, the erase destroyed the key but not the name, and the border
router refused the re-registration for as long as the old lease ran, up to 14
days. Commit `f7d3160` fixed it by storing a name suffix beside the key so both
die in the same erase. If you are on an older image, that is the symptom.

**The lock works but the phone never approaches it.** The reader only advertises
its Aliro service with the provisioned advertising parameters once it has an
identity, and on the Matter image the identity is minted by commissioning. A
`make flash-erase` takes the fabrics, the identity and the trust anchors with it,
so the board has to be added to Home again. To clear only what a controller can
see, hold **SW2 through reset** instead.

**The board refuses an over-the-air patch.** A delta is computed against the
exact bytes the board is running, and only the build host keeps that record. A
push from a phone is invisible to it, so `make fota-done` after every phone push
is what keeps the record true, and the cheapest way to see a mismatch.

**Nothing happens when you press SW2 during an update.** D10, the blue LED,
blinks at 2 Hz while the update window is open, and it follows the window rather
than the button, so it also goes out when the five minutes expire on their own.
A dark LED means no window, not a failed transfer.

**The image does not fit.** The Matter image is at 94.54% of its flash partition
and 95.38% of RAM, with 6,060 bytes of RAM left, so a new static allocation is a
decision rather than a detail. LTO is on by default and worth 41,084 B; `LTO=0`
no longer fits this flash map at all and the build says so.

## Build and flash (nRF5340 DK)

**`make nrf-build` stops before it starts, saying it will not build a bootloader
anybody can sign for.** Run `make dfu-key` once per clone. `DFU=1` is the default
here and MCUboot must be given a key this checkout owns; with none configured it
would fall back to the one published in MCUboot's own repository, which every
stock MCUboot already trusts. `DFU=0` builds the older no-bootloader bench layout
and needs no key. Same key and same target as the DWM3001CDK, so if you have
built that board you already have one.

**`make nrf-build` can't find the toolchain.** `make bootstrap` installs the NCS v3.3.0
toolchain as its second phase, so this normally means bootstrap has not been run here.
All builds go through `nrfutil sdk-manager toolchain launch … west`; a bare `west` is
not used. If your toolchain is managed some other way, `nrfutil sdk-manager config show`
names the directory bootstrap looks in, and `ULTRAWIDELOCK_TOOLCHAIN=env` uses whatever is
already on `PATH` instead.

**`make bootstrap` says nrfutil is not on PATH.** It is what installs the toolchain, so
bootstrap stops there rather than after the 6.5 GB fetch. `make tools` gets it on
macOS; elsewhere it is a
[download from Nordic](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-util).

**A config change flashed but did not take effect.** A change to net-core configuration
needs a full erase: use `make nrf-flash-erase`, not `make nrf-flash`. `make nrf-flash` is
app-core only and leaves the net-core image in place.

**`make nrf-term` shows nothing.** The console and Zephyr shell are on the DK's VCOM1; VCOM0
is silent. `make nrf-term` auto-detects VCOM1; override with `PORT=` if detection picks the
wrong port.

**Build succeeds but the image does not fit.** The default configuration targets a full
flash budget (app FLASH is ~89.7%). Extra features may need a config trim; build with
`PRETTY=1` for readable size output.

## Unlock behavior

The first diagnostic question is always: **does tap still work?** Tap exercises the BLE
transport, provisioning, and credentials. If tap works and only approach fails, the fault
is UWB-specific, not in the credential path.

**Tap works, approach never ranges.** Either no common protocol version was negotiated, or
the reader never emitted the `0x98` "URSK ready" trigger, so the phone reports
`URSK_Unavailable`. See [`protocol-research.md`](protocol-research.md) §4 and the field
guide in §10.

**Approach worked, then stopped after a reboot.** This is the time/credential-validity
path, not UWB. The RAM wall clock is erased on reset and falls back to a stale Last Known
Good Time, so freshly minted Access Documents are rejected as not-yet-valid. See
[`protocol-notes.md`](protocol-notes.md); this repo carries the ratchet and persist fixes
that address it.

**Approach stopped but tap and Matter still work, no reboot involved.** If the clock is
valid but behind real time by more than the advertisement window (default 900 s), phones
silently ignore the BLE advertisement because its dynamic-tag expiry lies in their past.
This is the interaction documented in [`protocol-notes.md`](protocol-notes.md); the board
overlay disables the dynamic tag until a real time source exists.

**Ranging dies after walking out of range, or after about 12 hours.** Expected: the URSK
has a 12-hour TTL and is dropped when the BLE link drops. A fresh access transaction
(cheap, via the fast path) re-arms it. See [`protocol-research.md`](protocol-research.md)
§8.

**Setup (M1-M4) completes but there are zero distance reports.** A radio-path or
parameter problem, not a control-stack one: check the antenna and channel (5 or 9),
confirm a time sync happened (wrong listen window otherwise), and check for a negotiated
parameter mismatch, which yields a different SaltedHash and therefore a different STS with
no shared frames. See [`protocol-research.md`](protocol-research.md) §6-§7.

## Hardware (nRF5340 DK and DWM3000EVB)

None of this applies to the DWM3001CDK, where the DW3110 sits on the same module
as the MCU and the wiring is internal. Its pin table is in
[`../apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/README.md`](../apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/README.md).

Pin assignments are defined in
[`apps/nrf5340dk-lock/overlays/dw3000-nfc.overlay`](../apps/nrf5340dk-lock/overlays/dw3000-nfc.overlay),
which is the source of truth. If the overlay changes, the wiring must change with it.

**The DW3000 is a 3.3 V part.** Power the DWM3000EVB from a 3.3 V rail, not 5 V. Share a
common ground with the host board.

**No SPI response / DW3000 not detected.** Confirm the EVB is powered (see above), the SPI
lines match the overlay, and the reset and IRQ lines are wired. `make nrf-selftest` builds
a boot self-test that exercises the radio bring-up with no phone present, which isolates a
wiring problem from a protocol one.

**The DWM3000EVB has its own power-select jumper.** Wiring the rails correctly is not
enough if that jumper selects the wrong source: SPI then fails silently, with no valid
device ID and a responder that never listens. Check it before suspecting software.

## ESP32-S3 ports

Full detail lives in [`docs/esp32-gotchas.md`](esp32-gotchas.md);
this is the short triage list.

**`dwt_probe failed: -1` the first time a phone reaches M4.** The DW3000 was never
brought up at boot, so the first SPI touch happens inside a NimBLE host callback, where
the shallow stack and missing init make probing fail. Bring the radio up once from a
dedicated startup task instead; both ports now do this.

**The bolt moves but the Wallet never animates.** Driving the lock is not the signal iOS
watches. The reader must send the Reader-Status-Changed grant message over the BleSK
channel; without it iOS shows only a plain Matter accessory notification. Neither the
phone's own computed distance nor the advertisement tag is the gate.

**The phone disconnects about 1.8 s after a successful EXCHANGE (reason 531).** The
reader did not send Reader-Status-Access-Protocol-Completed. It is mandatory, not
optional.

**`GeneralError URSK_Unavailable` at M1.** The ranging session id is derived from the
AUTH0 transaction id, not chosen by the reader. A hardcoded session id names a session
the phone has no key for. This is never a wrong-URSK-value problem: M1 carries no
URSK-derived material, so a value mismatch would surface later, at M2-M4 STS.

**`protocol 0 unsupported` fed to the ranging engine.** Ranging SDUs ride their own GCM
channel keyed from BleSK, with fresh per-direction counters, not the credential-auth
channel. Seeing the raw envelope type as a protocol number means the channel split was
missed.

**Ranging setup completes, POLL and Response look clean, but no distance is ever
computed.** On ESP32 this is usually a real-time fault, not a logic fault: a per-round
blocking log in a path with a 2 ms deadline starves the DW3000 ISR task, so the Final
callback dispatches too late to catch the phone's Final_Data. Throttle hot-path logging
first, then look at SPI transaction cost.

**Negative or absurd distances.** Suspect cross-round timestamp mixing before antenna
calibration. If the Final_Data of one round is decoded after the next round has
overwritten the shared timestamps, the arithmetic produces plausible-looking but wrong
values that still pass the integrity gate. Snapshot the intervals at Final capture. No
antenna calibration was needed on this hardware.

**Approach unlock works, then the bolt relocks 5 s later while the phone is still
there.** A fixed auto-relock timer fights approach unlock. Set `AutoRelockTime = 0` and
drive relock from proximity with hysteresis.

## Tests and CI gates

**`make check` says a gate COULD NOT RUN and exits nonzero.** That is deliberate, not a
warning: the gate's tool is not installed, and CI will run it whatever this machine has,
so "could not check" reads as "not verified". `make tools` fills the gap. To
accept it for one run instead, scope it out by name: `SKIP="cbmc docs" make check`.

**A gate passed here and failed on the PR.** Two usual causes. A version-pinned tool
(`clang-format`, `clang-tidy`, `zizmor`, `reuse`) disagreeing with CI's pin: `make tools`
flags a row that is off the pin. Or a gate that silently ran weaker here: without the
`markdown` python package the flash-HTML drift check skips, which `make tools` also
reports.

**`make check` is slow, or a failure is hard to read.** It runs in parallel lanes, so
rows arrive out of order and two lanes can fail in one sweep. `SERIAL=1 make check` runs
one gate at a time in table order. To re-run a single gate, scope the rest out with
`SKIP=`.

**`git pr` cannot run network, Emscripten, user-local tools, or `.venv` gates.**
Its disposable candidate deliberately has no network, real home directory, user-local
`PATH`, or gitignored files. Configure
`git config git-pr.verify make check`; the wrapper runs the hermetic
candidate checks and explicitly leaves the unavailable seven to CI. Do not configure
`make check` directly for that sandbox; it is the full developer sweep and
correctly treats those missing capabilities as failures.

**`python3 web/build.py` refuses to run.** It stops when `HEAD` is behind `origin/main`, because
regenerating from a stale tree writes stale pages. `git fetch origin && git merge
origin/main` first.
