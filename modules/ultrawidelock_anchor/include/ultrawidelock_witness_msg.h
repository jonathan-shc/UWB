/**
 * @file ultrawidelock_witness_msg.h — WV2, the BLE witness report on the wire.
 *
 * One datagram per summarisation window, witness -> lock, over Thread UDP.
 * This file is the codec and the validation rules ONLY. The portable sealed-link
 * core applies AES-CCM under the per-peer key through the primitive seam; the
 * consumer owns key storage and each platform supplies one primitive provider.
 *
 * Three properties the format is shaped by, in order:
 *
 * 1. NO PHONE IDENTIFIERS, AND THE LOCK NEVER LEARNS ONE. A tuple carries a
 *    24-bit truncation of a hash over an advertiser address under the WITNESS
 *    GROUP key, never the address. The group key is shared by the witnesses
 *    and NOT by the lock, so the label is consistent across the two witnesses
 *    -- which is the whole point, it is what lets one advertiser be compared
 *    inside against outside -- while remaining opaque to the lock and to
 *    anyone on the air.
 *
 *    The lock does not match these against anything it knows. It CANNOT: an
 *    earlier revision of this design had the lock hash the credential
 *    connection's peer address and match, and that is unsound. The phone is
 *    the central, so the address the lock holds is an InitA generated for the
 *    initiating role; the ambient traffic a witness hears comes from
 *    advertising sets with their own address state and their own rotation
 *    timers. The Core Spec permits one RPA across roles but does not require
 *    it, and nothing Apple documents promises it. The lock instead picks which
 *    label is the phone by trajectory correlation against its own
 *    authenticated UWB range -- see ultrawidelock_witness_pick.h.
 *
 * 2. FRESHNESS IS ASYMMETRIC. `ctr` is monotonic per (witness, boot_id) and
 *    catches ordinary replay. `echo_nonce` is the lock's current challenge,
 *    and only reports echoing it may CLEAR an inside veto -- a replayed
 *    genuine "phone is outside" window from yesterday is the one forgery that
 *    would actually open a door, so the clear direction gets a challenge and
 *    the veto direction does not. See ultrawidelock_latch.h.
 *
 * 3. A WITNESS HOLDS NO AUTHORITY. Every rule here is enforced by the lock on
 *    receipt. A witness that lies, replays, or floods can cost a passive
 *    unlock; it cannot cause one.
 *
 * Byte order is big-endian throughout, chosen to match the UWB message codecs
 * in this tree rather than the host. Fixed layout, no alignment assumptions,
 * no allocation: encode/decode are pure functions over caller-owned structs.

 * -- but the INSIDE witness, which hears that same phone through a door and
 * therefore ranks it below whatever else the house is running. If the phone
 * misses the cut there, the pair has no inside reading, quorum fails, and no
 * clear is possible. That fails safe and feels like a broken lock.
 *
 * Eight tuples plus the header is 85 B, still one 802.15.4 frame with room for
 * the seal. Raising the count was considered and rejected: past eight the
 * sealed report no longer fits one frame, and a fragmented report on a
 * sleepy end device loses more windows than the wider cut saves. The
 * lock instead hints its picked label back on the challenge so the witnesses
 * always include it -- see ultrawidelock_witness_core_include().

 * session that is not happening -- it can transmit Responses nobody asked for,
 * which costs air time and reveals nothing, because a responder that is not on
