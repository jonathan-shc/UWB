/**
 * @file ultrawidelock_link.h — the sealed peer link's decisions, carrier-free.
 *
 * Everything the sealed link does that is NOT sending bytes: compose a report
 * or a handoff, and decide what an arriving datagram is and whether to believe
 * it. No socket, no radio, no allocation, no threads — the caller owns the
 * struct and supplies the bytes, so this compiles and is tested on the host and
 * runs unchanged over Thread UDP or ESP-NOW.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. apps/satellite/src/anchor_link.c and
 * apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/src/witness_link.c each grew these decisions inline,
 * woven through their own transport. The ESP32 port needs the same decisions
 * over a different carrier, and reimplementing "is this fresh" per carrier is
 * how two ends of one link stop agreeing. The wire format here is byte-identical
 * to what those two already exchange, deliberately: a mixed bench — nRF lock,
 * ESP32 satellite — must keep working.
 *
 * Both Zephyr apps and the ESP32 satellite use this core. Carrier setup, key
 * persistence and dispatch stay with each consumer; wire and freshness rules
 * live here once, so a mixed bench cannot drift one endpoint at a time.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DECIDE. Whether an accepted report should move a door.
 * A datagram that unseals and clears the replay window is authentic and fresh;
 * pairing it with this node's own measurement of the same ranging block, and
 * everything downstream of that, is ultrawidelock_satellite.h's job.

/**
 * THE LOCK'S NONCE PREFIX, and the whole reason this constant is shared.
 *
 * ONE key travels in BOTH directions: the satellite seals WV3 reports with it
 * and the lock seals WV4 handoffs with it. Under AES-CCM a repeated
 * (key, nonce) pair leaks the XOR of two plaintexts and forges the tag, so the
 * two senders' nonce spaces must be provably disjoint, not merely unlikely to
 * collide.
 *
 * They are disjoint in byte 0. A satellite writes its ROLE there, and a role is
 * constrained to 1..3 (enum ultrawidelock_witness_role, and
 * ULTRAWIDELOCK_ANCHOR_ROLE's `range 1 3`). 0xFF is outside that range, so no
 * conforming anchor can emit it and no counter or boot id either side picks can
 * bring the two nonces together.
 *
 * If a role is ever widened past 3, this constant must move with it.
