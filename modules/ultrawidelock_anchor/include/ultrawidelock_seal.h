/**
 * @file ultrawidelock_seal.h — the sealed link's AES-CCM envelope, once.
 *
 * ONE definition of what a sealed datagram looks like on the wire:
 *
 *     nonce (13 B) ‖ ciphertext (plain_len B) ‖ tag (8 B)
 *
 * This existed twice — apps/satellite/src/anchor_link.c and
 * apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/src/witness_link.c each carried a copy — and the ESP32
 * satellite would have made three. Two copies of an envelope are two chances
 * for the nonce layout, the tag length or the associated-data choice to drift,
 * and the failure that drift produces is a peer whose every report is silently
 * rejected: indistinguishable, from the bench, from a radio that is not there.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, deliberately. Freshness. This layer proves the key and
 * nothing else. The counter, the boot id, the replay window and the challenge
 * echo are the caller's, because only the caller knows which peer a datagram
 * claims to be from — see ultrawidelock_witness_seen in ultrawidelock_witness_msg.h.
 * A datagram that unseals is authentic, not fresh.
 *
 * NONCE UNIQUENESS is a caller obligation and the sharpest edge here. AES-CCM
 * under a repeated (key, nonce) pair leaks the XOR of the two plaintexts and
 * forfeits the tag's unforgeability, so ultrawidelock_seal_nonce() composes the
 * one layout both ends agree on — role, boot id, counter, zeros — and the
 * caller must never seal twice under one counter value. Every existing sender
 * pre-increments its counter and then builds the nonce from the new value.
 *
 * Platform-free. AES-128-CCM reaches the selected provider only through
 * ultrawidelock_prim.h: PSA on nRF, and the mbedTLS-PSA provider on ESP32.
