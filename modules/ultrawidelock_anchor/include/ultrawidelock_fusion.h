/**
 * @file ultrawidelock_fusion.h — two-anchor fusion: which side of the door, and whether
 *       the two distances are geometrically possible at all.
 *
 * The sign of (d_inside - d_outside) says which side of the anchors' bisector
 * the phone is on -- which means "which side of the door" only if the anchors
 * are mounted symmetrically about the door plane; no code substitutes for that.
 * The triangle inequality over the known baseline gates asymmetric manipulation
 * and impossible pairs. It does NOT catch a symmetric relay, and needs not:
 * inflating both links makes the phone look further, which fails the unlock
 * radius on its own; reduction is defended by time-of-flight + STS, not this.
 * A consistency layer ON TOP of per-link integrity consensus, never instead --
 * feed it only distances that already passed their own link's gate.

 * UNKNOWN permits it because the alternative is worse. A satellite that has
 * gone quiet, a phone in the doorway, or a fresh boot all produce UNKNOWN, and
 * a door that refuses to open early in those cases has degraded from "quick"
 * to "locked out" for a reason its owner cannot see. Degrading to today's
 * single-anchor behaviour is the correct failure.
 *
 * Only a positive OUTSIDE verdict, or a failed triangle test, withholds it --
 * the two cases where there is real evidence that opening early is wrong.
 *
 * This gates prediction ONLY. The threshold unlock, which means someone is
 * actually standing at the door, is never gated on geometry: a mis-tuned floor
 * that refuses to open a door locks a human out of their house, and that
 * asymmetry is the same one that argues for the per-link STS gate.
