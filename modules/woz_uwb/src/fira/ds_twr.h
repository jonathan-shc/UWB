 * Lives at the base CONFIG_WOZ_UWB tier rather than in the CCC MAC because two
 * unrelated callers need it: the Aliro responder, which ranges a phone, and the
 * anchor-to-anchor bench link, which ranges another board and has no CCC engine
 * in its image at all.
 *
 * THE RESULT IS SIGNED, and that is the entire reason this file exists. The
 * numerator is a difference of two products, and at short range the round
 * product is the smaller of the two -- so an unsigned accumulator underflows to
 * ~1.8e19 and the divide returns a garbage distance instead of a small negative
 * one. An earlier `uint32_t ccc_ds_twr_tof()` had exactly that flaw; it was
 * never called in production (the responder open-coded a signed version to
 * dodge it) and has been replaced by this.

 * @param t The four intervals; NULL yields 0.
 * @return Time of flight in ticks. NEGATIVE near contact, where measurement
 *         noise exceeds the true flight time -- callers converting to a
 *         distance must keep the sign and apply their own plausibility floor
 *         rather than clamping here, because "slightly negative" and "wildly
 *         wrong" want different responses. 0 if the denominator is 0.
