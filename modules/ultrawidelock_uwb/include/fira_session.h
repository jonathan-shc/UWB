 *
 * A DS-TWR distance is trustworthy only when it is (1) physically plausible,
 * (2) backed by a well-correlated STS, and (4) consistent with recent blocks.
 * (Layer 3, an Ipatov first-path check, was removed — untunable on this HW —
 * so the numbering keeps a gap.) Layers 1 and 4 are enforced in the range
 * store (fira_session_set_ccc_range_cm); layer 2 is a pure predicate the
 * responder RX path evaluates, since it owns the DW3000 diagnostics. Every
 * threshold below is a bring-up default — tune on the bench.
 *
 * Layer 2 is recorded rather than enforced here, on purpose, because its two
 * consumers want opposite failure modes. A door lock must not refuse to open
 * on a marginal block — a mis-tuned floor locks a human out of their house —
 * so it keeps the shadow behaviour and only drops blocks under
 * CONFIG_ULTRAWIDELOCK_RANGE_GATE_STRICT. A signed presence assertion is the opposite:
 * it exists to be believed by someone who was not there, so it must refuse to
 * state a distance it cannot vouch for. The store therefore carries the
 * verdict alongside the range and lets each consumer pick.

/* Layer 1 — plausibility band. Below -NEG_TOL is physically impossible (an
 * early-first-path / Ghost-Peak spoof drives ToF sharply negative); above MAX
 * is outside any credential proximity envelope. A small negative is legitimate
