/** @file uwb_cirdiag.c — CIA RX-diagnostics latch + [ALAB] emitter (channel-impulse Stage 0/1).
 *
 * Split the work across the two contexts the ALAB contract demands: the RX callback only
 * latches registers into a snapshot (uwb_cirdiag_capture, plain stores + one SPI read), and a
 * task-side uwb_cirdiag_flush formats/prints the line. On the nRF the flush runs on the
 * sysworkq (uwb_rxdiag.c submits it); on the ESP32 the pinned ISR-service task calls it after
 * its IRQ drain loop, so capture and flush are sequential there. A seqlock covers the
 * one real race (nRF: a new capture preempting a flush mid-copy): torn snapshots are dropped,
 * the next reception re-latches.
 *
 * The windowed-CIR dump (independently armed) also reads a fixed window of
 * Ipatov complex taps centred on the first-path index. Taps are never printed
 * on the RX/flush path (~64 serial lines would stall a walk-up): flush appends
 * windows to a RAM ring, drained to `ev=uwb.cir` lines only when the dump is
 * disarmed, in task context. The window READ itself only happens on a Final
 * (deadline_pending), before the SP0 re-arm (ccc_shim_rx_awaiting_final), and
 * decimated to one Final in CIRDIAG_CIR_EVERY -- each of those three gates was
 * measured necessary to keep ranging alive while capturing.
