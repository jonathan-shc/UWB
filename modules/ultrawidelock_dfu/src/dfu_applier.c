/**
 * @file
 * @brief Applies a staged delta patch onto the primary slot, from inside
 *        MCUboot.
 *
 * SYS_INIT at APPLICATION level: after the flash driver (POST_KERNEL), before
 * MCUboot's main() -- the only window in which the primary slot can be
 * rewritten, and no upstream MCUboot line is edited. It cannot live in the
 * application, which executes from the slot being rewritten. A normal boot
 * costs one word read (header magic mismatch, return).
 *
 * SAFETY: the header CRCs itself (torn write fails); patch and from-image are
 * CRC-checked before a byte is erased; and MCUboot re-verifies the P-256
 * signature of the RESULT before booting it, dropping to serial recovery on
 * failure. The worst a forged patch achieves is destroying the installed image
 * (recoverable), not installing code. Power cuts are expected -- this rewrites
 * most of 442 KB over seconds; detools' step counter (step_set/step_get) is
 * what makes that survivable.

 * its decompressor produced -- `to_size = MIN(sizeof(to), chunk_size)` at
 * detools.c:1936 -- so both the address and the length are arbitrary. nRF flash
 * has a 4-byte write block, so handing those straight to flash_area_write()
 * fails on any chunk that is not word-aligned and word-sized, which is most of
 * them. The shift loop earlier in the patch (detools.c:1690-1711) happens to
 * use 128-byte aligned chunks and works either way; the patch phase does not.
 *
 * So bytes accumulate here and only whole words go to flash. A partial tail is
 * held until either the next contiguous write completes the word, or something
 * proves the region is finished -- a write somewhere else, a read, an erase, or
 * the end of the patch -- at which point it is padded with 0xff. Padding is
 * correct there precisely because the region IS finished: detools has moved on,
