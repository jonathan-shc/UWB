/**
 * @file
 * @brief The on-flash contract between the application and the bootloader for
 *        a delta firmware update.
 *
 * The application receives a patch over Bluetooth and writes it into the
 * `patch_staging` partition. MCUboot reads it on the next boot and applies it
 * onto the primary slot. Nothing else connects the two, so this header IS the
 * interface: a change here that is not made on both sides produces a board
 * that stages an update and then silently declines to install it.
 *
 * Plain C11 with no Zephyr dependency, so the host tests and the patch builder
 * can include it and agree on the layout by construction rather than by
 * transcription.

 * the credential stack, before it ever writes this header. The bootloader is the flash-starved
 * image and only has to answer a narrower question: did the bytes I am about to
 * apply arrive intact, and do they belong to the image I am running? A CRC
 * answers both.
 *
 * The floor underneath both is MCUboot's own image validation:
 * `CONFIG_BOOT_VALIDATE_SLOT0=y` re-verifies the P-256 signature of the
 * RESULT before booting it. So a forged header cannot install code -- it can
 * only destroy the current image, and `CONFIG_BOOT_SERIAL_NO_APPLICATION=y`
 * catches that in recovery rather than in a boot loop.
 *
 * Every field is little-endian. Total 32 bytes, word-aligned throughout,
 * because the nRF flash driver writes words.
