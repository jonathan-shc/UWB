/**
 * @file woz_ml_lin.c — how sure the tree is, which the tree itself cannot say.
 *
 * A single decision tree's leaf IS its class, so woz_ml_los_classify() answers
 * "obstructed" and has no second quantity to offer. This supplies one: the
 * distance from a linear boundary fitted on the same two features, which was
 * measured to separate the receptions the tree gets right from the ones it gets
 * wrong. See woz_ml.h for the measurement and ai/tinyml/RESULTS.md Result 16.
 *
 * The coefficients are generated; only the arithmetic is written by hand, and
 * there is not much of it.
