// Persistent reader provisioning storage: identity and credential trust anchors saved to and

/*
 * ultrawidelock_prov — the reader provisioning seam (Phase 3.4): the reader's own
 * identity (a stable reader identifier + P-256 signing key) and the trust store
 * of credential public keys it authenticates presented credentials against.
 * NVS-backed on target, with a clearly-marked dev fallback so the credential-auth
 * transaction can be driven at bench before Phase-4 Matter provisioning writes a
 * real identity.
 *
 * Split like ultrawidelock_crypto: the (de)serialisation + dev default + trust logic is
 * portable (ultrawidelock_prov.c); the NVS load/store is target-only (ultrawidelock_prov_nvs.c,
 * not compiled on host).
