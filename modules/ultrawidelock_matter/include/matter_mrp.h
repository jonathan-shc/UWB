/**
 * @file matter_mrp.h — Message Reliability Protocol: backoff, retransmit, dedup.
 *
 * Matter runs over UDP, so reliability is the application's problem. MRP is the
 * answer: mark a message as needing an acknowledgement, retransmit on an
 * exponential backoff until it is acked, and drop counters you have already
 * seen.
 *
 * Two objects with two different lifetimes, deliberately not merged:
 *   struct matter_mrp_window  per SESSION   — duplicate suppression
 *   struct matter_mrp         per EXCHANGE  — one un-acked message, one owed ack
 *
 * NO TIMERS LIVE HERE. Every entry point takes `now_ms` and the object only
 * computes deadlines, so the caller owns the timer. The backoff applies the
 * MRP_BACKOFF_MARGIN term per Matter Core §4.12.2.1, as CHIP does.

 * That port drives only matter_mrp_window_* -- duplicate suppression and the
 * replay window -- and never arms a retransmit timer. Everything it SENDS is a
 * reply to something the peer just sent, except the subscription report, and
 * the peer retransmits its own requests until it is answered. So the one thing
 * a timer here would add is resending a lost report.
 *
 * Which is exactly what the heartbeat already covers. matter_commission.c
 * re-reports every SUBSCRIPTION_HEARTBEAT_S (120 s) against a max_interval of
 * 600 s, so a lost report costs the subscriber a stale LockState for at most
 * two minutes and never costs it the subscription. Against that: a retransmit
 * timer needs a saved copy of every outstanding message on a part with about
 * 4 KB of RAM left, and it wakes a sleepy end device whose poll period is
 * 3,000 ms to resend a 67-byte report the heartbeat will resend anyway.
 *
 * Wire it up when this node gains something that must arrive PROMPTLY and is
 * not a reply -- an event, or a report whose staleness matters in seconds
 * rather than minutes. Until then the cost is real and the benefit is not.
 *
 * The engine stays because it is tested (tests/host, matter_mrp) and because
 * the ESP32 port and any future initiator need it; it is unused here, not dead.
