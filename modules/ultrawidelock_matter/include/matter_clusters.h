/**
 * @file matter_clusters.h — what this device answers, as opposed to how.
 *
 * matter_im.c owns the ReportData wire format and knows nothing about door
 * locks or vendor IDs. This is the other half: the endpoints, clusters and
 * attributes that exist, and what they say.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately the commissioner's FIRST question and no further. A
 * real iPhone, immediately after PASE, reads nine attribute paths:
 *
 *   endpoint 0  GeneralCommissioning 0x0030  attributes 0x00..0x04 and 0x0C
 *   endpoint 0  BasicInformation     0x0028  VendorID 0x02, ProductID 0x04
 *   endpoint 0  TimeSynchronization  0x0038  all attributes (wildcard)
 *
 * Everything else answers UNSUPPORTED_*, which is a legal answer and a truthful
 * one. Clusters get added when a commissioner is observed asking for them,
 * rather than because the spec lists them.
 *
 * Device-specific values arrive in @ref matter_device_info instead of being
 * read from Kconfig here, so the host suite can build this without Zephyr and
 * assert on the encoded bytes.

 *
 * A node that reloads its fabric table from storage is commissioned but not
 * REACHABLE: the Thread dataset has not been handed to the stack and no SRP
 * instance exists, so the controller resolves nothing and reports the accessory
 * dead. Commissioning does both of those as a side effect of
 * AddOrUpdateThreadNetwork and AddNOC; this is that same pair, for the boot
 * path that has no commissioner to trigger them.
 *
 * Call it after loading @p info and only when a fabric was actually restored.
 *
 * @return MATTER_OK when Thread started and every fabric was advertised,
 *         MATTER_E_STATE when there is no stored dataset to start from.
