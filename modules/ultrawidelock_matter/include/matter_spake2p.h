/**
 * @file matter_spake2p.h — SPAKE2+ glue: PBKDF2, transcript, confirmations.
 *
 * SPAKE2+ is how PASE turns a short setup passcode into a session key without
 * ever putting the passcode on the wire. The elliptic-curve arithmetic is NOT
 * here: it comes from nrf_oberon, which ships four primitives that do exactly
 * the operations SPAKE2+ needs. Everything around them -- deriving w0 and w1
 * from the passcode, building the transcript, and turning it into the
 * confirmation values -- is this file, and all of it is byte manipulation and
 * hashing that the host suite can check.
 *
 *   w0, w1   PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256(passcode, salt, iterations) -> 80 B -> two
 *            40-byte halves, each reduced mod the P-256 group order
 *   TT       ten elements, each prefixed with its length as a little-endian
 *            uint64: context, "", "", M, N, pA, pB, Z, V, w0
 *   Ka|Ke    SHA256(TT), first half and second half
 *   KcA|KcB  HKDF(Ka, "ConfirmationKeys")
 *   cA, cB   HMAC(KcA, pB) and HMAC(KcB, pA)
