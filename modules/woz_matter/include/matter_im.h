/**
 * @file matter_im.h — the Interaction Model, as far as a commissioner needs it.
 *
 * Once PASE is done the commissioner stops speaking Secure Channel and starts
 * asking questions. The first one is a ReadRequest, and until something answers
 * it the phone waits, gives up, and shows "pairing failed" with no further clue.
 *
 *   in    ReadRequest   (protocol 0x0001, opcode 0x02)
 *   out   ReportData    (protocol 0x0001, opcode 0x05)
 *
 * This is the read half only. Write, Invoke and Subscribe are separate messages
 * and land when something needs them; commissioning cannot start without Read.
 *
 * It holds no device data. Which endpoints exist and what their attributes say
 * is matter_clusters.h's, reached through @ref matter_im_server, so the wire
 * format can be tested without a device and the device without a wire.
