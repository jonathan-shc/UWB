/**
 * @file matter_tlv.h — Matter TLV codec (Matter Core spec, Appendix A).
 *
 * This is NOT the BER/DER-TLV in modules/woz_aliro_stack/src/protocol/tlv.h.
 * Matter uses its own encoding: one control byte carrying a 3-bit tag control
 * and a 5-bit element type, then 0-8 tag octets, then the value, all
 * little-endian. The two share a name and nothing else, so they stay separate.
 * A tag is one uint64_t -- profile ID in the high 32 bits, tag number in the
 * low 32 -- because a register pair costs less than a struct here.

 *      skip would let a peer choose this firmware's stack depth, on a part
 *      where the system work queue was measured with 528 B to spare.
 *   2. NO COPYING. Strings and octet strings are returned as a pointer into
 *      the caller's buffer, so decoding allocates nothing and cannot truncate.
 *      The pointer is valid exactly as long as that buffer is.
 *
 * Iteration is CHIP-shaped because the shape is right: next() moves along the
 * current level and steps OVER a container it was not told to enter; enter()
 * descends; exit() skips whatever is left of the current container and lands
 * just past its end marker.
