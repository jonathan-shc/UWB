/**
 * @file matter_pase_sm.h — PASE responder: the device side of the five messages.
 *
 * matter_pase.h is the codec and matter_spake2p.h is the arithmetic; this is
 * what drives them. A commissioner opens with PBKDFParamRequest and this
 * answers, receives Pake1, answers Pake2, receives Pake3, and ends with a
 * StatusReport. What comes out the far side is a session key schedule.
 *
 *   -> PBKDFParamRequest    <- PBKDFParamResponse   (context hash fixed here)
 *   -> Pake1 (pA)           <- Pake2 (pB, cB)
 *   -> Pake3 (cA)           <- StatusReport(success)
 *
 * The device never holds the setup passcode. It holds the SPAKE2+ verifier --
 * w0 and L -- which is derived from the passcode somewhere else and provisioned
 * in. That is the whole point of the augmented form: someone who reads the
 * device's flash cannot impersonate a commissioner to it.
 *
 * No time and no randomness are taken from the environment. Retransmission is
 * MRP's job (matter_mrp.h), and the two random values PASE needs are arguments,
 * so the host suite runs the real state machine against a recorded exchange
 * rather than against whatever entropy it happened to get.

 * Cross-checked against two implementations, as with every layer below it:
 *   - CHIP, workspace/modules/lib/matter/src/protocols/secure_channel/
 *     PASESession.cpp: the responder path at :408 (request), :595 (Pake1),
 *     :780 (Pake3), the failure code it answers with at :459,618,723,801 and
 *     the success one at :840. The StatusReport body is
 *     StatusReport.cpp WriteToBuffer() and PairingSession.h:145-150, which is
 *     also where the general code is decided from the protocol code.
 *   - CircuitMatter (github.com/adafruit/circuitmatter): the same sequence at
 *     circuitmatter/__init__.py:290-360, including the detail that the context
 *     hash is taken over the request and response payloads exactly as they were
 *     framed rather than over re-encoded structures.
 *
 * They agree on the order, on which side sends what, and on the StatusReport at
 * the end. One difference worth recording: CHIP answers every PASE failure with
 * kProtocolCodeInvalidParam (0x0002) regardless of what actually went wrong,
 * and this does the same -- telling an unauthenticated peer which step it got
 * wrong is free information about the verifier.
