/**
 * @file matter_exchange.h — the unsecured exchange PASE runs on.
 *
 * Between BTP (a byte pipe) and PASE (five messages) sits the part that makes a
 * Matter message a message: which session it belongs to, which exchange, whether
 * it is a duplicate, and whether the peer is owed an acknowledgement.
 *
 *   in    message header | protocol header | payload
 *   out   message header | protocol header | payload
 *
 * This handles exactly one exchange on the UNSECURED session, which is all
 * commissioning needs before PASE finishes: session id 0, no encryption, the
 * peer as initiator and this node as responder. Secure sessions are a different
 * object -- they carry keys and a different counter -- and arrive with CASE.
 *
 * It deliberately does not know what PASE is. It reports the opcode and hands
 * back the payload; the caller decides what to answer. That keeps the framing
 * testable on its own, and means CASE will reuse it rather than fork it.
 *
 * No timers here either. Duplicate suppression and the ack bookkeeping are
 * state, not scheduling; retransmission is matter_mrp.h's, driven by whoever
 * owns a clock.
