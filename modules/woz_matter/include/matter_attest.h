/**
 * @file matter_attest.h — proving to a commissioner that this is a real device.
 *
 * After the fail-safe is armed, the commissioner stops asking what this node is
 * and starts asking it to prove it. Three questions, in this order:
 *
 *   CertificateChainRequest  give me your DAC, then your PAI
 *   AttestationRequest       sign this nonce with the DAC's private key
 *   CSRRequest               make me a key I can certify, and sign for it
 *
 * The certificates are static blobs. The signatures are not: each covers the
 * message AND the session's attestation challenge, which is why a recorded
 * exchange cannot be replayed into a different session.
 *
 * WHAT THESE CREDENTIALS ARE. The DAC, PAI and CD here are the SDK's published
 * development credentials for vendor 0xFFF1 / product 0x8001, and the DAC's
 * private key is published alongside them. They prove nothing about who built
 * this device -- anyone can extract the same key from a public repository, and
 * a commissioner that enforces attestation will reject them. They are here so
 * commissioning can be developed against a real phone; shipping a product means
 * a DAC issued under a real PAI, and its private key must not live in flash
 * next to the certificate.
