/**
 * @file matter_btp.h — BTP, the Matter commissioning transport over BLE GATT.
 *
 * A Matter message is far larger than a BLE ATT payload, so BTP chops it into
 * fragments, numbers them, and acknowledges them. This file is the framing
 * only: no GATT, no Zephyr, no timers. The 0xFFF6 service that carries it is a
 * separate piece.
 *
 *   handshake req   0x65 0x6C  versions[4]  mtu:u16  window:u8      (9 bytes)
 *   handshake resp  0x65 0x6C  version:u8   fragment:u16  window:u8 (6 bytes)
 *   data fragment   flags:u8  [ack:u8 if A]  seq:u8  [len:u16 if S]  payload
 *
 * Little-endian, like the rest of Matter.

 * ONE SOURCE, NOT TWO. Every other file in this module was cross-checked
 * against CHIP and CircuitMatter. CircuitMatter has no BLE at all -- it is an
 * IP-only node, with no btp/ble module anywhere in the package -- so BTP has
 * only CHIP to check against, and the usual second opinion is missing. What
 * partly replaces it is CHIP's own test suite, which pins exact bytes rather
 * than restating the header layout:
 *   - layout and validation: src/ble/BtpEngine.h:43-53,80-86 and
 *     src/ble/BtpEngine.cpp:227-355 (the receive path, field order and every
 *     refusal).
 *   - handshake: src/ble/BleLayer.cpp:78-79 (the two check bytes),
 *     :157-241 (both codecs), src/ble/BleLayer.h:87-112,124 (lengths, the
 *     4-bit version packing, V4 as the only supported version).
 *   - golden fragments: src/ble/tests/TestBtpEngine.cpp:60-123, whose byte
 *     arrays are reproduced in the suite rather than paraphrased.
 * Treat anything here that is NOT covered by one of those citations as the
 * weakest part of the module.
