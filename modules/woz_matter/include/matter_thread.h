/**
 * @file matter_thread.h — the seam between a commissioner's dataset and a radio.
 *
 * matter_clusters.c is platform-agnostic C11 and the host suite compiles it
 * without Zephyr, so it cannot call OpenThread. It calls these two instead; the
 * port forwards them to otDatasetSetActiveTlvs() and otThreadGetDeviceRole(),
 * and the host suite substitutes a double whose answers a test can choose.
 *
 * The split into start and wait is deliberate. Apple sends
 * AddOrUpdateThreadNetwork, then ArmFailSafe, then ConnectNetwork, and the
 * attach can begin at the first of those rather than the last -- a Thread
 * attach costs seconds and the round trips in between are free.
