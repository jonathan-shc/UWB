/**
 * @file ultrawidelock_ml_log2.c — log2 of an integer from its leading bit and a small table.
 *
 * log2(v) splits exactly into an integer part and a fractional one:
 *
 *     v = 2^e * (1 + m),  0 <= m < 1
 *     log2(v) = e + log2(1 + m)
 *
 * e is just where the leading one sits, which is one CLZ instruction on
 * Cortex-M4, and m is the bits underneath it. So the only thing that needs
 * approximating is log2(1 + m) over a single octave, and that is what the
 * generated table holds: nine entries, linearly interpolated.
 *
 * Nine entries is enough: eight-segment linear interpolation worst-cases at
 * 0.0029 log2 units (0.017 dB through the callers), and the binding error is
 * the reader's whole-centimetre range anyway -- table sizes 8 to 64 all bottom
 * out at the same 0.183 dB.
