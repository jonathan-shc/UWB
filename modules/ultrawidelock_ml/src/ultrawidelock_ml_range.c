 *
 * Removing 20*log10(d) normalises every reception to what it would have
 * measured at one metre; what is left is attenuation the range does not
 * explain, the classifier's strongest feature. log10f would cost ultrawidelock_ml its
 * no-undefined-symbols property, so ultrawidelock_ml_log2.c supplies the logarithm and
 * this file is only the change of base and the clamp. Accuracy does not bind:
 * even 2 dB rounding moves balanced accuracy by +0.0005, and the dominant
 * error is the reader's whole-centimetre range (~0.4 dB at the short end), not
 * the table (0.017 dB).

/*
 * The two measured constants, in millimetres because both landed on a half
 * centimetre and rounding them here would be inventing precision in one
 * direction. RESULTS.md Result 19 is the measurement.
 *
 * ANTENNA_OFFSET is what this board reports short by, and it is not the model's:
 * nothing in this project has ever programmed the DW3000 antenna-delay
 * registers, so every range it produces carries a fixed offset. Two clear runs a
 * doubling of range apart measured -25.0 cm and -26.0 cm, agreeing to a
 * centimetre, which is the signature of an offset rather than a scale error.
 *
 * NLOS_BIAS is what a body in the path adds. Measured with the phone on a tripod
 * so only the subject moved: +80.0 cm at 1 m and +89.0 cm at 2 m, and the
 * difference between those two is +8.0 cm with a 95% interval of [-9, +17], so a
 * constant fits and a scale factor does not -- scaling would have predicted about
 * 160 cm at 2 m against an observed [73, 92].
 *
 * NLOS_BIAS DID NOT REPLICATE AND NOTHING SHOULD ENABLE IT. Result 21 repeated
 * the tripod capture with a second body at the same 100 cm and measured +115.0 cm
 * over all frames and +127.0 cm [+109, +136] at len=46, against session 1's +82.0
 * [+62, +93] in the same slice: the intervals do not overlap, so these are not two
 * estimates of one constant. What replicated was the CHANNEL, -10.1 dB and -9.6 dB
 * of first-path power in the two sessions, which is the classifier's input and not
 * this offset. The likeliest reason is that session 1's subject stood midway and
 * session 3's stood against the tripod, making the offset a function of where the
 * blocker is; session 1 could not have seen that, because it varied reader-to-phone
 * distance while holding blocker position fixed by accident.
 *
 * Subtracting the wrong amount fails in the dangerous direction -- a phone genuinely
 * at 185 cm reads as 100 and the door opens for a walk-by -- so aliro_approach's
 * cfg.range_correct_en defaults false and should stay there. The supportable use of
 * the classifier is to WIDEN unlock_cm while obstructed, which needs the sign of the
 * effect (replicated) rather than its magnitude (not replicated).
 *
 * ANTENNA_OFFSET is unaffected: -25.0, -26.0, -21.0 and -24.0 cm across four clear
 * runs in two sessions is still an offset.
