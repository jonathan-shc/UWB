 * aliro_approach — predictive approach controller ("negative latency").
 *
 * Turns the per-block trusted UWB range stream into bolt decisions. Presence
 * path: median filter + near/far dwell counters across a hysteresis band (slow
 * shuffles still unlock). Prediction path: a 1-D constant-velocity Kalman
 * filter yields distance + closing speed; when the ETA at the unlock radius
 * drops inside the retraction window (motor_ms + margin_ms), retraction starts
 * early so it COMPLETES at arrival. Invariant: open only while an authenticated
 * credential is closing -- prediction needs a converged filter, speed above
 * vmin_cm_s and two qualifying samples, and an opened bolt relocks the moment
 * the approach stops or the arrival is overdue.
 *
 * Pure logic, caller-allocated state, no platform dependencies. Call from task
 * context only (float math; never from the UWB RX/ISR path).

	 *
	 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It is not an inside/outside test. Someone indoors

	 * TWO CORRECTIONS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS CONDITIONAL, which is the whole
	 * design. RESULTS.md Result 19 measured this reader as reporting 25.5 cm
	 * short of true, always, because nothing programs the DW3000 antenna delay.
	 * That is calibration and it applies unconditionally. It also makes the lock
	 * STRICTER: unlock_cm = 100 has really been firing at a true 125 cm.
	 *
	 * The second is that a body in the path adds a constant 84.5 cm, so an owner
	 * with the phone on the far side of themselves reads 155 cm at a true 100
	 * and never crosses the threshold. Undoing that ADDS permission, so it is
	 * gated three ways: the reception must be classified obstructed, the
	 * classifier's confidence must clear nlos_conf_min, and it must hold across
	 * a majority of the median window (see aliro_approach_feed_channel).
	 *
	 * WHAT A WRONG ANSWER COSTS, stated because it is the reason for the gates.
	 * A false obstructed subtracts 84.5 cm, so a phone genuinely at 185 cm reads
	 * as 100 and the door opens for a walk-by. At the measured per-reception
	 * false rate of 4.7%, a majority of five brings that to about 1 in 1,035
	 * while still engaging on 94.9% of genuinely blocked windows.
	 *
	 * LEAVE THIS FALSE. Result 21 repeated Result 19's capture with a second body
	 * and measured the obstruction offset at +127.0 cm [+109, +136] against the
	 * original +82.0 [+62, +93] in the same frame-length slice, intervals not
	 * overlapping. The gates above bound how often the correction engages
	 * wrongly; they cannot bound how wrong it is when it engages rightly, and a
	 * 47 cm spread is larger than the margin the paragraph above is defending.
	 * The obstruction itself replicated cleanly as -10 dB of first-path power in
	 * both sessions, so the classifier is sound and only this subtraction is not:
	 * the supportable use is to widen unlock_cm while obstructed, which needs the
	 * sign and not the magnitude. The antenna half would be safe on its own but
	 * is not separately switched, because it has never had a caller that wanted
	 * one without the other.
	 */
	bool range_correct_en;
	/*
	 * Confidence floor for the obstruction correction, in the units
	 * woz_ml_los_confidence() returns. 2.61 is the top quartile boundary
	 * measured over the 399 tripod receptions of Results 18 and 19, where the
	 * linear sign is right 96% of the time against 39% in the bottom quartile.
	 * Install-dependent: it is one room, one phone and one body.

	 * shippable half of what Results 18-21 measured. 0 disables it, which is the
	 * default, because the right number is an install's policy and not a constant
	 * this file can know.
	 *
	 * WHY THIS AND NOT range_correct_en's SUBTRACTION. Result 21 killed the
	 * subtraction because its magnitude did not replicate across two bodies
	 * (+82.0 against +127.0, non-overlapping intervals) while its SIGN did, along
	 * with the -10 dB of first-path attenuation the classifier actually reads. A
	 * widening consumes only the sign: it says "be more permissive while a body
	 * is in the way" and leaves how much to the installer, where a subtraction
	 * claims to know a true distance it does not know.
	 *
	 * IT IS NOT SAFER, AND SAYING SO WOULD BE WRONG. Widening to 220 opens for a
	 * misclassified walk-by at 220 exactly as subtracting 120 would. Two things
	 * are genuinely better and neither is permissiveness. First, the subtraction
	 * fed a fabricated distance into the Kalman filter, so a wrong constant
	 * corrupted the velocity estimate and every ETA built on it; this touches one
	 * comparison and the estimator never sees it. Second, a policy number invites
	 * the tuning it needs, where a measured-looking constant invites trust it has
	 * not earned.
	 *
	 * The false-positive arithmetic from range_correct_en carries over unchanged,
	 * because the gate is the same one: a 4.7% per-reception false rate through a
	 * majority of five is about 1 in 1,035 windows, engaging on 94.9% of genuinely
	 * blocked ones.
	 *
	 * Clamped at init to keep unlock_cm + nlos_widen_cm strictly below
