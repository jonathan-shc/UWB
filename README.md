The CSA's door-lock credential protocol on real hardware: BLE, NFC (ECP), and
UWB ranging. Three complete locks, plus reader, initiator, and anchor examples.

## Quick start

**No hardware.** A C compiler and `python3` is the whole list.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ultrawidelock/ultrawidelock.git
cd ultrawidelock
make check                  # 7 host suites, about 2 minutes
```

**With a board.** Default is the Qorvo DWM3001CDK: nRF52833, DW3110 radio, and
a J-Link, all on one part. Nothing to wire.

```sh
make dfu-key                # once per clone   · image-signing key, gitignored
make bootstrap              # once per machine · NCS v3.3.0, several GB
make build                  # -> build/cdk-matter
make flash                  # over the on-board J-Link
make monitor                # console, over RTT
```

`make help` lists every target. `make tools` says what this machine is missing.

Local only. No app, no account, no cloud round trip.

## The board

One nRF52833, 512 KB flash and 128 KB RAM, runs all of this at once:

| | On the same part |
|:--|:--|
| 📶 | **BLE peripheral** the iPhone talks the credential protocol to |
| 🔑 | **Reader**: AUTH0 / AUTH1 / EXCHANGE, key ladder, STS, DS-TWR |
| 🏠 | **Hand-written Matter node** ([`modules/ultrawidelock_matter`](modules/ultrawidelock_matter/)), not CHIP |
| 🧵 | **OpenThread MTD**, so it joins a real Thread network |
| 📏 | **DW3110 UWB ranging**, over the module's internal SPI |

It fits in 379,332 of 433,664 B flash and 111,012 of 131,072 B RAM.
`make cdk-size-check` fails if that regresses.

**No tap on this board.** No NFC reader IC, and the nRF52833's own NFC is tag
emulation only. Walk-up only here; for a tap use the nRF5340 DK.

Also builds: `make reader` (radio alone, no Matter) and `make selftest`
(DW3110 device ID over SPI at boot).

## Other boards

| Application | Hardware | Connectivity |
|---|---|---|
| [`apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/`](apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/) | DWM3001CDK | UWB, Matter over Thread |
| [`apps/nrf5340dk-lock/`](apps/nrf5340dk-lock/) | nRF5340 DK, DWM3000EVB, NFC12A1 | UWB and NFC, Matter over Thread |
| [`apps/esp32-matter-lock/`](apps/esp32-matter-lock/) | ESP32-S3 / C5 / C6 with DWM3000EVB | UWB, Matter over Wi-Fi |

```sh
make nrf-build && make nrf-flash && make nrf-term    # nRF5340 DK
make esp-go APP=matter-lock TARGET=esp32s3           # ESP32: build, flash, monitor
make hitl                                            # unattended end-to-end bench
```

<details>
<summary>ESP32 toolchain paths</summary>

<br/>

ESP32 needs an installed ESP-IDF, and the Matter lock also needs esp-matter.
Neither is pinned here; both default under `$HOME/esp`, overridden with
`IDF_EXPORT` and `ESP_MATTER_PATH`. The bench builds against ESP-IDF v5.5.4 and
esp-matter `93b1680`.

## Update over the air

No cable, no probe. Two MCUboot slots do not fit on a 512 KB part, so what
travels is a signed delta.

```sh
make dfu                    # build, diff, sign, push
make fota                   # instead: one file a phone can install
make fota-done              # after every phone push
```

`make fota-done` is not optional. The delta is cut against the exact bytes on
the board, and only the build host keeps that record.

## Before you rely on it

- **Console is RTT, not UART.** `make monitor` attaches with the ELF you
  flashed. The ring survives reset, so the first block is the previous run.
- **`make flash-erase` costs the commissioning.** Apple Home has to add the
  lock again.
- **Never lock APPROTECT.** Recovery needs a mass erase, which takes the
  reader's private key and every phone key on it.
  `scripts/check-approtect.sh` checks a part.
- **These are bench defaults.** Do not secure valuables with it.

## Use as an SDK

Include only your role:

```c
#include <ultrawidelock/reader.h>     // reader
#include <ultrawidelock/device.h>     // initiator
#include <ultrawidelock/tlv.h>        // codec only
```

Ports implement the five seams in `<ultrawidelock/ultrawidelock_hal.h>`: DW3000
GPIO/IRQ, DW3000 SPI, reader BLE, central BLE, credential storage. New board or
chipset: [`PORTING.md`](PORTING.md).

<details>
<summary>Plain CMake consumers</summary>

<br/>

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/sdk -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$PWD/build/sdk-install"
cmake --build build/sdk
cmake --install build/sdk
```

Exports `UltraWideLock::headers` and `UltraWideLock::tlv`; version comes from
the root `VERSION`. Working example in
[`examples/cmake/consumer/`](examples/cmake/consumer/), and `add_subdirectory`
works too. `make sdk-check` verifies both paths.

Full firmware is consumed through the Zephyr module or the ESP-IDF components.
The all-in-one `<ultrawidelock/ultrawidelock.h>` pulls in every declaration.
