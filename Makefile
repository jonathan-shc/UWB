# Makefile — single command entry point for the UltraWideLock firmware.

# A dispatcher, not an implementation: shared variables, the per-port includes
# below, and the `help` renderer. Every recipe lives in mk/<port>.mk, grouped by
# what it builds rather than by verb, so a target's neighbours are the other
# targets for the same board.
#
#   make                 # this grouped, colourised help
#   make build           # the DWM3001CDK lock (Matter over Thread) -> build/cdk-matter
#   make nrf-build       # the nRF5340 DK image                     -> build/nrf5340dk
#   make esp-build APP=matter-lock TARGET=esp32s3                   -> build/esp32-matter-lock-esp32s3

# Bare build/flash/monitor mean the DWM3001CDK because that is this project's
# headline target: one nRF52833 carrying the Aliro reader, the DW3110's ranging,
# a hand-written Matter node and an OpenThread MTD. The other two boards keep
# their own prefixes.

# ---- the MCUboot image-signing key ------------------------------------------
# ONE key per checkout, shared by both Zephyr ports: it is the answer to "what
# firmware will a board of mine boot", and that question has one answer here.
# `make dfu-key` (mk/setup.mk) generates it and never overwrites it, both ports
# refuse to build without it (scripts/check-signing-key.sh), and it is
# gitignored, so a fresh clone or a new worktree fails at configure until it has
# one.
#
# Fresh checkouts keep it with the DWM3001CDK app. Existing checkouts retain the
# old ignored path below, so this migration cannot silently mint a second key.
#
# The path MUST be absolute; scripts/check-signing-key.sh explains why a
# relative one silently becomes MCUboot's published demo key. Exported so the
# port scripts read it rather than each keeping its own default.
