# Does graphify need to run again? Prints "absent", "stale", or nothing.
#
# `make docs` asks this before offering to re-extract, because extraction walks
# ~900 files and is worth neither the time nor the prompt when nothing it reads
# has changed.
#
# Staleness is decided by modification time against the trees graphify's output
# is actually derived from, not by comparing HEAD to the graph's built_at_commit.
# The commit comparison looked tidier and was wrong: it re-extracted after every
# commit, including the ones that only touched a guide, the website, or the
# Makefile -- none of which can change a single node or edge.
