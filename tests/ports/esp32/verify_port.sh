#   1. the esp32s3 build still links,
#   2. the CCC STS seam is still wired (all four uwb_seam.h helpers defined, and
#      the engine reaching the radio through them rather than around them),
#   3. the excluded diagnostic files stay out of the build,
#   4. the app still fits its partition.
#
# Auto-sources the ESP-IDF env via $IDF_EXPORT (default $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh,
# same convention as examples/esp32/reader/Makefile; override to relocate). Skips with a
# clear notice if ESP-IDF is absent, so the fast host test (run.sh) never needs it.
