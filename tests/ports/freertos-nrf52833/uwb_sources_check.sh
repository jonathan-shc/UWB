# Hold the port's UWB source set to what it claims.
#
# ports/freertos-nrf52833/uwb/uwb.cmake declares that set, and the host suite
# has no cross-compiler to link it with. Until a target build runs, a path that
# does not exist or a configuration that selects the wrong backend is invisible
# here and surfaces as an unrelated missing symbol at someone else's first link.
# So it is asserted now.
#
# The fragment is read by CMake itself, in script mode, with the handful of
# commands the surrounding build would have supplied stubbed out so the library
# it declares can be inspected instead of built. Re-parsing the file by hand
# would only check this script's copy of the expansion rules.
#
# What is checked, and how each one goes wrong quietly:
#
#   every manifest exists   a renamed role manifest expands to nothing rather
#                           than to an error, so its sources simply vanish
#   every path resolves     a manifest entry naming a moved file still compiles
#                           on the ports that do not read it
#   the PSA backend         this port has a PSA provider and the ESP-IDF one
#                           does not, so copying that port's selection links a
#                           second path to the same primitive
#   the Final snapshot      not a diagnostic on this part: without it the ranges
#                           are kilometres wide, on a single core where BLE
#                           shares the CPU with the ranging callbacks
