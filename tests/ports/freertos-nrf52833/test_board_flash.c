/*
 * The board's flash hooks on NVMC.
 *
 * The controller model refuses a write outside write mode, an erase outside
 * erase mode, a write that would set a bit, and a misaligned address. Those are
 * the rules a driver gets wrong once and then corrupts flash with, so the test
 * asserts the violation counter stays at zero as well as asserting the results.
 *
 * The radio-arbitration half is not implemented, and what is checked here is
 * that its absence is a refusal rather than a write issued underneath a live
 * radio.
