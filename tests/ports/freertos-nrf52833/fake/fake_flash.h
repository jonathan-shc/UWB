/*
 * A model of the nRF52833 internal flash that enforces the part's rules rather
 * than merely storing bytes. A store written against a model that lets you
 * overwrite a word, or write a byte at an odd address, works on the model and
 * bricks the board.
 *
 * Enforced: an erased byte reads 0xff; a write may only clear bits, never set
 * one; writes are word-aligned and a whole number of words; an erase covers
 * whole pages. Every violation is recorded and returns failure.
