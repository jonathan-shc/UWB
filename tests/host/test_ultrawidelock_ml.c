/**
 * @file test_ultrawidelock_ml.c — certify the shipped LOS/NLOS tree against sklearn.
 *
 * This is not a regression pin. `ultrawidelock_ml_los_vec_expect` is what scikit-learn
 * itself answered for each vector, so a pass means the C on the target agrees
 * with the model that was trained, not merely with its own past behaviour.
 * gen_model.py (tinyml repo) refuses to emit the model unless that agreement is
 * exact over all 6,300 held-out samples; these vectors carry the claim into CI,
 * stratified so every one of the pruned tree's leaves is reached.
 *
 * Only a single tree can be tested this way. A random forest's generated C
 * disagrees with sklearn on 0.92% of samples at emlearn's defaults and 0.06%
 * with leaf_bits=8, which selects soft voting instead of majority voting. 0.06%
 * is still not the exact agreement this file demands, so a forest still has no
 * oracle -- but it misses by 4 samples in 6,300 rather than 58, and the cause is
 * 8-bit leaf quantisation rather than the architecture.
