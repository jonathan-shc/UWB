/**
 * @file test_matter_client.c — the file that sequences the client, under test.
 *
 * Everything the Matter client needs is a pure function somewhere in
 * modules/ultrawidelock_matter, and every one of them is tested next to itself. This
 * suite is about the layer above: the order they are called in, the one session
 * and one attempt they share, and the clock they are driven by. That layer is
 * where both of this file's known bugs lived, and neither was reachable from a
 * module test, because in a module test nothing sequences anything.
 *
 * What is NOT here, and why: nothing past the Sigma1. Getting a real session
 * established needs a peer that can answer with a cryptographically valid
 * Sigma2, which is the responder half -- and that loopback already exists, in
 * test_matter_case_client.c, against the CASE code rather than against this
 * scheduler. Wiring it through this file is worth doing and is not done here.
 * So: resolve, target choice, framing, addressing, the two routing predicates
 * and the failure paths are covered; the established-session interaction is
 * not.
 *
 * The clock is the suite's, not the system's -- see ultrawidelock_osal_host_advance_ms().
 * Time only moves where a case says it does, so a timeout is something these
 * tests step over deliberately rather than something they wait for.
