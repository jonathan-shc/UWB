# cdk_size_test.sh — the DWM3001CDK size gate, checked without a build tree.
#
# CI builds no firmware (see ci.yml's header), so this cannot measure a real
# image. What it can do is pin the two things that were actually got wrong while
# the gate was written, and the refusals that make its numbers trustworthy:
#
#   1. THE ACCOUNTING RULE. A first version summed PT_LOAD segment sizes and
#      reported 131,240 B of RAM used against a 131,072 B part -- a negative
#      free figure -- because Zephyr's ELF nests a covering RAM segment around
#      the .data and .ramfunc ones. ld reports the SPAN from the region origin
#      to the highest byte placed, padding included. The segment tables below
#      are the real ones from a decawave_dwm3001cdk build, and the expected
#      figures are what that build's linker printed. If account_segments stops
#      reproducing ld, this fails.
#
#   2. LTO SYMBOL NORMALISATION, without which the top-mover list is noise:
#      GCC renumbers .lto_priv/.constprop/.isra clones between builds.
#
#   3. THE COMPARATOR'S REFUSALS. A delta measured across a toolchain bump, an
#      overlay change or an LTO flip is not a delta, and reporting one is worse
#      than reporting nothing -- LTO alone is worth 41,084 B on this image. It
#      must exit non-zero rather than produce a number.
#
# Exit 0 clean, 1 on a failure.
