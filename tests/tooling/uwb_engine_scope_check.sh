# uwb_engine_scope_check.sh — keep the DW3000 engine's file set closed.
#
# WHAT IS BEING PREVENTED. The public UWB contract is the six functions in
# modules/ultrawidelock_uwb/include/ultrawidelock/uwb.h; everything that names the Qorvo
# radio API (dwt_* calls and types, deca_*.h headers) is the DW3000 engine
# backend behind that contract, and it is a closed set of files. A dwt_ call or
# deca include added anywhere else quietly re-couples the chip-agnostic zone —
# the FiRa session logic, CCC key schedule, Aliro adapter, apps — to one
# vendor's silicon, and the next chipset port inherits it as a rewrite. This
# gate keeps the boundary mechanical: a new chipset implements the contract,
# it never edits the zone.
#
#   tests/tooling/uwb_engine_scope_check.sh              # scan the tracked sources
#   tests/tooling/uwb_engine_scope_check.sh --self-test  # prove the gate can fail
#   make check / make scope                              # runs it as `uwb engine scope`
#
# Exit 0 clean, 1 on a finding, 2 if the gate could not do its job.

# Trailing comments are stripped before matching, so a struct field documented

# macros are deliberately NOT matched: ARM CoreSight (DWT->CTRL, DWT_CTRL_*)
# owns that prefix on Cortex-M, and Qorvo's DWT_ macros cannot be used without
# a deca include, which is matched.
